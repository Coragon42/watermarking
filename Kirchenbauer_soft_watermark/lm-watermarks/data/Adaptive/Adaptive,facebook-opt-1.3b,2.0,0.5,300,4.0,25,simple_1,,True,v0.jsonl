A lot of drug dealers say they got into dealing because it was the only way they could imagine making enough money to buy nice things and provide for their families.   \n@@@In the US, the prison population is predominantly BIPOC and low-income, meaning they've experienced a lot of oppression before they entered. They may not have had access to adequate legal representation because our public defenders are criminally overworked. They're exploited for free or cheap labor (watch the 13th by Ava Duvernay), and they leave in debt and a record that will disqualify them from some jobs and housing and come up in background checks for those that are available.   \n@@@So, for a lot of incarcerated people, snitching is not going to protect people.
