{"prefix": "Q: Mandatory arbitration\nA:", "gold_completion": "Attorney here.  Normally when the parties to a contract are in a dispute, one of them can file a lawsuit in the courts to try to get the problem sorted out. Sometimes, the parties will agree to have someone smart and experienced but who is not a judge(an arbitrator) basically conduct an informal trial just like a judge, and the parties agree that they'll treat that decision just like it was done by a judge.  Agreeingto treat the arbitrator's decision just like a judge's decision is what makes the decision *binding.* \nThe parties can make the agreement to use an arbitrator at any time. Sometimes it might be after they start disputing and they both just figure it's faster and cheaper to use arbitration. In that situation, neither has to; if you'd rather use the courts, you can decline to arbitrate.  \n*Mandatory* arbitration is when you can ONLY resolve a dispute through arbitration. The agreement to skip the courts and only use arbitration almost always comes as part of signing the main contract.  So like when you enter a cell phone contract,  that contract will usually include a provision that says both sides agree that they'll only take their disputes to arbitration through so-and-so arbitration organization. \nMany people see this kind of arbitration as favoring the company because of the company is always having so-and-so organization doing the arbitration,  that's a lot of money for the organization,  and some people think that the organization is going to return the favor and make rulings in the company's favor.  \nSo why would anyone agree to mandatory binding arbitration?  It's because they essentially have no choice. You have the choice not to buy the product or enter the contract at all, of course... but if you do decide to enter that contract,  you're pretty much stuck with the contract terms. It's take it or leave it. In contracts where each side thinks the other is important enough,  they can negotiate and tweak certain parts. But in a deal between the average schlub and Blizzard, Blizzard isn't going to waste their time trying negotiating the contract. Take it or leave it, they say.  \nIn various places, laws have been passed to say that for some types of contract,  you must have the right to change your mind about mandatory arbitration, but will put a time limit on that.  So for instance, in my last cell phone contract I had 30 days after signing the contract to tell the phone company I didn't want to do mandatory arbitration. \nGetting rid of mandatory arbitration would mean that Activision/Blizzard might not be so confident about their chances of success in arbitration, in which case maybe they'd behave better toward their customers.", "gen_completion": ["To create a right to arbitrate and bar a right to sue over state-law claims in federal court.\nA: An agreement to arbitrate and bring all disputes into arbitration is a legal agreement.

This isn't a problem because you have all the location of the books catalogued, so what you do is cut the book in half and catalogue part one on one shelf and part two on a shelf down the hall. This data is now fragmented. This works fine, but can obviously get annoying to have to run to two sections of the library to go get that info. So you under go the great library defragmentation. You basically take all the books down and re-arrange them so no book is broken up like that. This is data defragmentation.", "gen_completion": ["a file which can be fragmented Defragmentation is one which reshapes the fragmented file.\nQ: Why does a defragmentation take longer if it's done frequently? A: If it's done frequently and consistently it does take longer. This is probably because each fragment breaks up into smaller fragments thereby making it a longer and more detailed defragmentation. The longer and more detailed a defragmentation is carried out the better it does. Even better would be doing a regular and consistent defragmentation. This can be done manually (recommended) and automatically. An auto defragmenter will schedule and take care of it automatically for you. Q: Are non-contiguous fragments handled differently during defragmentation? A: Yes and they are defragmented automatically and instantly. The non-contiguous fragments are automatically and immediately handled and defragmented during a regular defragmentation. They will not be defragmented if a non-regular and non-recommended defragmentation is carried out. During a regular and consistent defragmentation they are automatically defragmented."]}

{"prefix": "Q: Why is crime increasing in Democratic cities?\nA:", "gold_completion": "There are a lot of issues that contribute to this, some if it's policy related, some of it isn't.\nFirst, DAs are an elected position and the seat can be bought for practically nothing. Many DA seats have been taken over by activists who will drop criminal charges depending on who it is. Because of this, people feel like they have a chance to get away with it.\nThen there's the issue in some cities in California having a rule where any petty theft under $995 will not be pursued. This has lead to people shoplifting on mass because they know they can get away with it.\nTo add, being stuck in your house without a job can really tax on people. This is why a lot of people were going out and marching because despite covid, the marches themselves were not really policed in spite of people being really close to one another. This promoted people to be activists even when they didn't believe or really understand what was going on. Now that the activism has slowed down due to the election being over, people are still used to wondering the streets and given that they've been told they live in a racist system and that capitalism is evil, it's not a surprise that many people would vandalize places in these cities.\nAlthough the weather isn't as much of a factor, it is getting nicer out so people are going out more. A lot of crime is spontaneous, you see a house, no one is watching, you wrap your head in a shirt and break in to steal some shit.\nNot to mention that covid killed a lot of jobs and now that people have been not working for several months, people have decided that they don't want to work, which has caused a labor shortage. This leads to people being overworked because the jobs they do still demand work from them only now there's less help, and that causes stress, frustration, and that might be channeled from the previous point on being an activist. It can also just result in fights breaking out, people are on edge and there's a lot of division in the country right now.\nAnd no, it's not just the summer, places like NYC have a jump in crime %22 compared to this time last year.

{"prefix": "Q: Repudiation Attack\nA:", "gold_completion": "Let's start with the simplest attack, and work up to the more complex.\nAlice owns a bank.  Bob somehow gains access ( dumpster diving for passwords on paper, or threatening Alice employee, etc ).  Bob then can steal information,  This is known as an ACCESS ATTACK.  The downside ( from Bob's point of view  ) is that Bob has information, but he has to engage in some second activity to monetize it.\nSuppose Bob wants to do a bit more, particularly if he wants to damage Alice's bank.  He goes to his stockbroker, buys puts ( contracts that guarantee the sale of a stock at a certain price ) then changes Alices web page.  Bob has graduated from reading data to writing data.  This is known as a MODIFICATION ATTACK.\nWhen the world reads that Alice's web page that now openly supports Stormfront, her stock tanks, and Bob buys the stock at a low price, invokes the contract with his broker, and sells at a high price.  This is riskier than a simple access attack because there are now clear traces showing how Bob profited.  There is also the downside that Alice will be very aware that she has been attacked, and this will lead her to harden her defenses, and to call the cops.\nSo Bob may add a new wrinkle.  He not only modifies information in Alice's database, but he then defrauds Alice directly, using her corrupted data against her.   **It is this direct, post-modification contact that make Bob's actions a REPUDIATION ATTACK**.\nBob, in preparation for the attack, took out a loan with Alice's bank.  When he does his modification attack, he changes Alice's records to show that he paid off the loan.  When Alice's bank requests the regular monthly payment from Bob, Bob calls up Alice's customer service, and informs them that they made a mistake.  They check their records, and decide that the loan is indeed paid off.\nSo Bob walks away with free money.    The upside of the repudiation attack is that if Bob has done it skillfully, Alice may never know.  Bob may be able to do it multiple times.\nThe downside - from Bob's point of view - of a repudiation attack is that he has to give up some contact information to Alice.  If Alice's security people are on their toes, they might be able to trap Bob.\nSuppose that Charlie, Alice's data security officer, is indeed on his toes.  Prior to Bob's attack, Charlie wrote a maintenance program that runs in the background, checking all alleged payments.   Any time a payment is recorded as having been made, Charlie's program attempts to match the payment with ACH records from whichever bank was the other party in the transfer.\nAny time that the maintenance program detects a problem, it sends a text message to Charlie.  When Bob commits his modification attack, Charlie knows about it within minutes.\nCharlie contacts Dave, the agent who works in the financial crimes division of the local FBI office.  Charlie has Bob's telephone number from the call to customer service, and Bob's social security number and home address from the loan application.  Dave then gets a warrant to search Bob's premises.\nDave then goes...well, we are getting a bit off topic now.  We will leave Dave and Bob to their cat and mouse games.
