Oka's unit of about 650 men attacked the Marines at several locations on the west side of the Lunga perimeter. At about 04:00 on 14 September, two Japanese companies attacked positions held by the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment (3/5) near the coast and were thrown back with heavy losses. Another Japanese company captured a small ridge somewhat inland but was then pinned down by Marine artillery fire throughout the day and took heavy losses before withdrawing on the evening of 14 September. The rest of Oka's unit failed to find the Marine lines and did not participate in the attack. At 13:05 on 14 September, Kawaguchi led the survivors of his shattered brigade away from the ridge and deeper into the jungle, where they rested and tended to their wounded all the next day. Kawaguchi's units were then ordered to withdraw west to the Matanikau River valley to join with Oka's unit, a march over difficult terrain. Kawaguchi's troops began the march on the morning of 16 September. Almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounded. As the march progressed, the exhausted and hungry soldiers, who had eaten their last rations on the morning before their withdrawal, began to discard their heavy equipment and then their rifles. By the time most of them reached Oka's positions at Kokumbona five days later, only half still carried their weapons.

{"time_completed": 1741869641, "prefix": "The mountains lie within the Basin and Range Province or Great Basin of the Western United States, which is characterized by a series of parallel fault blocks that form long north\u2013south mountain ranges separated by wide, high-desert valleys. The Trout Creek Mountains are uplifted and tilted blocks with steep escarpments along the southern and eastern sides of the range. The southern area of the range, known as The Granites, has numerous outcroppings of Cretaceous age granite. These granite outcrops are commonly found in the eroded valleys below the volcanic ridgelines. The Trout Creek Mountains are composed mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where Steens Mountain is today. Crustal thinning and the Yellowstone hotspot, which was then beneath southeastern Oregon, induced eruptions from Steens and nearby vents about 17 million years ago, in the Miocene. The vents produced a series of lava flows that spread across the land now known as the Trout Creek Mountains. Eruptions from the Steens volcano lasted for about one million years, and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred. Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older metamorphic rocks that may be related to some of the Triassic age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon. Within these metamorphic rocks are diorite and granodiorite intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the Cretaceous Period. The broad McDermitt Caldera is a prominent geologic feature in the Trout Creek Mountains. The oval-shaped caldera is a collapsed lava dome that straddles the Oregon\u2013Nevada border on the eastern side of the range and south of the Oregon Canyon Mountains. It is about long and wide. The lava dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early Miocene. A total of five large ash flows were produced along with a large rhyolite dome structure. The caldera formed when the dome collapsed about 16 million years ago.", "gold_completion": "The caldera contains significant ore deposits, and mercury and uranium have been mined at eight or more sites in and around the caldera. Other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony, cesium, and lithium. The Trout Creek Mountains are semi-arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. When moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward over the Oregon and California coastal ranges and the Cascade Range, most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the Trout Creek Mountains.", "gen_completion": ["In most areas of the volcanic ridgeline, the lava dome rocks are exposed. In a few areas, including nearby Fremont Peak and Steens Mountain, thin sedimentary rocks and some volcanic rocks lie on top. The post-Miocene sedimentary and volcanic rocks are part of the Haggart Mountain Member, which lies beneath Fremont Peak and McDermitt Caldera. The sediments were probably deposited along the eastern margin of a rift valley. Fremont Peak and McDermitt Caldera are post-Miocene basalt volcanic centers. Some of these volcanic centers are now a part of a series of volcanic cones which have been built along the western edge of the Steens Mountain Range. The Steens Mountain Range volcanic cones are mainly basalt andesite volcanic rocks, and they are tilted up about 22 degrees. The Miocene volcanism continued for about 3 million years and created a series of volcanic cones and calderas along the western part of the Steens Mountain Range. Volcanism continued with smaller calderas. The tilted volcanic rocks of Steens Mountain are exposed where the newer sediments are removed from the volcanic cones.

In the latter position, he was influential in securing two large military training posts for Kentucky: Camp Zachary Taylor and Fort Knox. Though Camp Zachary Taylor was abandoned after World War I, Fort Knox became the home of the US Bullion Depository. After the United States entered World War I, Beckham continued to back Wilson and later supported the League of Nations. True to his prohibitionist stance, Beckham supported passage of the Eighteenth Amendment, which enacted Prohibition in the United States. The amendment was ratified and became effective in January 1920. Believing that women should be protected from involvement in politics, Beckham opposed the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women's suffrage. The amendment failed on February 10, 1919 but passed on June 4, 1919. Beckham voted against it both times. The Democrats renominated Beckham without opposition in 1920. His opponent in the general election was Republican Richard P. Ernst. Prohibition had destroyed the distilling industry and the saloon business in the state, and in areas that those industries were prominent, Beckham received more than 5,000 fewer votes than Democratic presidential nominee James M. Cox. He was also hurt by the women's vote and by his support of Wilson, who had lost popularity since Beckham's election, in 1914. Ernst won the election by fewer than 5,000 votes, winning the race with 50.3% of the vote to Beckham's 49.7&%. During his only term in the Senate, Beckham served alongside three other US Senators from Kentucky: Ollie M. James, George B. Martin, and Augustus O. Stanley. After his term in the Senate ended, Beckham resumed his legal practice in Louisville. He sought another term as governor in 1927. This time, he had the support of the Louisville Courier-Journal, which had been purchased by his ally, Robert W. Bingham. He was opposed by a powerful political machine, known as the Jockey Club, whose main interest was securing legislation to allow parimutuel betting at the state's horse racetracks.", "gold_completion": "The Jockey Club ran a candidate in both parties' primary elections.

Fields, who had been elected with the help of the Jockey Club.", "gen_completion": ["While seeking this legislation, however, which would be detrimental to Kentucky's interests as Beckham saw it, and which would bring Gov. A.B. \"Happy\" Chandler into office (whose election would mark the end of Beckham's government), he was opposed for another term as governor by the Republican majority. In 1929, Beckham resigned from his chairmanship of the Kentucky Liquor Commission. The distillery industry had nearly disappeared and saloons were closing as a result of prohibition. A cooperative marketing plan had been developed which would have helped distilleries and saloons return to their former positions. However, opposition from the Republican majority in the state legislature resulted in Beckham's resignation and Republican James A. Blair succeeded him as chairman.

Seven Klansmen, including a deputy sheriff, were convicted by an all-white jury in the federal courthouse in Meridian of \"depriving the victims of their civil rights\". Three defendants were acquitted in the trial for the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner. This was the first time that a white jury had convicted \"a white official in a civil rights killing.\" In 2005, the state brought charges in the case for the first time. Edgar Ray Killen was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 60 years in prison. Meridian later honored Chaney by renaming a portion of 49th Avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service. Starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that made commuting easier, residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north. After strip commercial interests began to move downtown, the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city. The Meridian Historic Districts and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979, and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985. Meridian Main Street organized several projects to revitalize downtown. This included construction of a new Amtrak Station in 1997, based on the design of the historic train station used during Meridian's Golden Age; it had been demolished. Other projects included renovation of the Rosenbaum Building in 2001 and Weidmann's Restaurant in 2002, as well as support for integrated urban design. Meridian Main Street, along with The Riley Foundation, helped renovate and adapt the historic Grand Opera House in 2006 for use as the \"Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts.\" After ownership of the Meridian Main Street was transferred to the Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007, the two organizations, along with the Meridian Downtown Association, spearheaded the downtown revitalization effort. The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization, allowing the other two organizations to use its support staff and housing, and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations. Plans were underway to renovate the Threefoot Building, but newly elected Mayor Cheri Barry killed the plans in early 2010.", "gold_completion": "Today, the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops, restaurants, and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night. The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events, and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown. Given Meridian's site as a railroad junction, its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels.

The 2012 renovation plan includes renovation and reconstruction of some portions of the Threefoot Building. In 2013, a \"hybrid\" plan for renovation of the Threefoot Building was developed. In 2014, plans for renovation were abandoned again. The Riley Center has been used as a concert and performance venue for over a decade, and recently became used as a private club, membership which can be obtained from a downtown business. On September 21, 2012 a dedication ceremony for a statue honoring James Meridian was held in front of City Hall. The ceremony included a baton pass to a group including Governor Phil Bryant and former Mayor Charles Perkins. In 2012, while renovation plans were abandoned again for the Threefoot Building, plans were developed for renovation and reconstruction for a large part of it. A ground-breaking ceremony for a combined arts and cultural center and conference center for the Threefoot Building was held on October 21, 2013.

{"time_completed": 1741871613, "prefix": "When tailoring his 1970 composition \"I'm the Greatest\" for Starr to record on the 1973 album Ringo, Lennon referenced the song title with the lines \"Now I'm only thirty-two / And all I want to do is boogaloo\". Having earmarked the song as his next single, Starr recorded \"Back Off Boogaloo\" in September 1971, following his appearance at the Harrison-organised Concert for Bangladesh in New York. The sessions took place at Apple Studio in central London, with Harrison producing, as he had on \"It Don't Come Easy\". The recording reflects the influence of glam rock on Starr through what authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter term \"its big drum sound and repetitious nature\". The line-up comprised Starr (vocals, drums, percussion), Harrison (guitars), Gary Wright (piano) and Klaus Voormann (bass, saxophone). Rodriguez describes Starr's \"martial-sounding opening\" as a rare \"showcase for his own drumming\", while Harrison biographer Simon Leng writes of \"a roaring series of Harrison slide breaks that brought to mind Duane Allman\". Starr later said that he incorporated a hook he had come up with for the Beatles song \"Get Back\" into his drum part on \"Back Off Boogaloo\". Further overdubs on the track included contributions from three backing vocalists, led by American soul singer Madeline Bell. For the single's B-side, Starr had already written and recorded \"Blindman\". It was intended to be the theme song for the Ferdinando Baldi-directed Spaghetti Western Blindman, filming for which Starr had interrupted in order to perform at the Concert for Bangladesh. The song was passed over for inclusion in the film, since producer Tony Anthony favoured an original score by Stelvio Cipriani. Starr produced the track with Voormann.", "gold_completion": "The recording sessions took place at Apple on 18\u201319 August, with Badfinger guitarist Pete Ham assisting Starr and Voormann. Like the film, \"Blindman\" was not held in high regard by critics. Spizer describes it as \"a muddy-sounding dirge with little to recommend\". By contrast, director and author Alex Cox believes that the song \"works well, in the context of the film\" compared to Cipriani's score, which he considers \"lazy\".", "gen_completion": ["Its sleeve on the album shows Starr holding a gun over a dead man as his colleague and their dog stand and look on. The album version begins with a John Lennon-sounding harmonica, which was overdubbed while Ringo was away on location. The instrumental mixes and reversals also mirror what Starr and Harrison would later achieve on The Beatles' own \"Revolution 9\". Author Ian MacDonald writes of \"Blindman\" being \"nothing more\" than \"a short western melody with subtly off-kilter harmonica and a slide guitar part\". The song found favour with radio stations as a standalone 45-rpm single release. When the song first aired on WLS-Chicago, the radio station received hundreds of letters from listeners. Apart from television appearances, including a repeat on the American music series The Andy Williams Show, \"Back Off Boogaloo\" and \"Blindman\" were promoted on the radio through Ringo. In his opinion on the single, music historian Paul Mac Lawrence writes: \"Even three decades later, it remains the apex of [Starr]'s first-half-of-the-seventies endeavours\" and \"it [shows] how he remained one of the [most] unique musicians of his generation.\" The song \"Back Off Boogaloo\"/\"Blindman\""], "too_short": false, "z-score": [7.159143337951359, 5.865884600854132], "wm_pred": [1, 1], "gen_length": [300, 186], "num_green": [212, 133], "are_tokens_green": {"8011": ["Its", 1, 1], "12844": ["sle", 1, 1], "29872": ["e", 0, 1], "345": ["ve", 0, 1], "373": ["on", 1, 8], "278": ["the", 0, 8], "3769": ["album", 1, 2], "3697": ["shows", 1, 1], "624": ["St", 0, 2], "2749": ["arr", 1, 3], "13587": ["holding", 1, 1], "263": ["a", 1, 8], "13736": ["gun", 1, 1], "975": ["over", 1, 2], "7123": ["dead", 1, 1], "767": ["man", 1, 1], "408": ["as", 1, 2], "670": ["his", 1, 3], "23056": ["colle", 1, 1], "3437": ["ague", 1, 1], "322": ["and", 1, 7], "1009": ["their", 1, 1], "11203": ["dog", 1, 1], "2317": ["stand", 1, 2], "1106": ["look", 0, 1], "29889": [".", 1, 5], "450": ["The", 1, 6], "1873": ["version", 1, 1], "16410": ["begins", 1, 1], "411": ["with", 0, 3], "2259": ["John", 1, 1], "365": ["L", 0, 1], "2108": ["enn", 0, 1], "265": ["on", 0, 1], "29899": ["-", 1, 8], "29879": ["s", 1, 2], "12449": ["ounding", 1, 1], "10311": ["harm", 1, 2], "26082": ["onica", 1, 2], "29892": [",", 0, 6], "607": ["which", 1, 1], "471": ["was", 0, 2], "29881": ["d", 0, 1], "431": ["ub", 0, 1], "2580": ["bed", 0, 1], "1550": ["while", 1, 1], "17716": ["Ring", 1, 2], "29877": ["o", 1, 2], "3448": ["away", 1, 1], "4423": ["location", 1, 1], "11395": ["instrument", 1, 1], "284": ["al", 0, 3], "6837": ["mix", 1, 1], "267": ["es", 1, 1], "18764": ["revers", 1, 1], "1338": ["als", 1, 1], "884": ["also", 1, 1], "19571": ["mirror", 1, 1], "825": ["what", 1, 1], "26954": ["Harrison", 1, 1], "723": ["would", 1, 1], "2678": ["later", 1, 2], "6176": ["achieve", 1, 1], "18573": ["Beat", 0, 1], "793": ["les", 1, 1], "29915": ["'", 0, 2], "1914": ["own", 1, 1], "376": ["\"", 1, 9], "1123": ["Re", 1, 1], "4068": ["volution", 1, 1], "29871": ["", 1, 2], "29929": ["9", 1, 1], "1642": ["\".", 0, 2], "13361": ["Author", 1, 1], "22291": ["Ian", 1, 1], "4326": ["Mac", 0, 2], "28080": ["Donald", 0, 1], "15873": ["writes", 1, 2], "310": ["of", 0, 5], "10358": ["Bl", 0, 3], "513": ["ind", 0, 3], "1171": ["man", 0, 3], "29908": ["\"", 1, 7], "1641": ["being", 1, 1], "28450": ["nothing", 1, 1], "901": ["more", 1, 1], "1135": ["than", 0, 1], "29874": ["a", 1, 1], "3273": ["short", 1, 1], "15782": ["western", 1, 1], "9232": ["mel", 0, 1], "1486": ["ody", 1, 1], "12059": ["subt", 1, 1], "368": ["ly", 0, 1], "1283": ["off", 0, 1], "16757": ["kil", 1, 1], "357": ["ter", 0, 1], "20343": ["slide", 1, 1], "11210": ["guitar", 1, 1], "760": ["part", 1, 1], "4823": ["song", 1, 3], "1476": ["found", 1, 1], "15381": ["favour", 1, 1], "7155": ["radio", 1, 3], "16355": ["stations", 1, 1], "18785": ["alone", 0, 1], "29946": ["4", 0, 1], "29945": ["5", 0, 1], "29878": ["r", 1, 1], "3358": ["pm", 0, 1], "2323": ["single", 0, 2], "6507": ["release", 1, 1], "1932": ["When", 1, 1], "937": ["first", 1, 2], "2859": ["ired", 0, 1], "399": ["W", 0, 1], "8547": ["LS", 1, 1], "1451": ["Ch", 1, 1], "9384": ["icago", 1, 1], "5073": ["station", 1, 1], "4520": ["received", 1, 1], "21006": ["hundreds", 1, 1], "8721": ["letters", 1, 1], "515": ["from", 1, 2], "11621": ["listen", 1, 1], "414": ["ers", 0, 1], "319": ["A", 1, 1], "1595": ["part", 0, 1], "11456": ["television", 1, 1], "21712": ["appearances", 1, 1], "3704": ["including", 1, 1], "12312": ["repeat", 0, 1], "3082": ["American", 1, 1], "4696": ["music", 1, 2], "3652": ["series", 1, 1], "21828": ["Andy", 1, 1], "11648": ["Williams", 0, 1], "7704": ["Show", 0, 1], "5841": ["Back", 0, 2], "5947": ["Off", 1, 2], "1952": ["Bo", 0, 2], "468": ["og", 1, 2], "3634": ["oo", 0, 2], "892": ["were", 1, 1], "21201": ["promoted", 0, 1], "1549": ["through", 1, 1], "512": ["In", 1, 1], "9426": ["opinion", 1, 1], "27629": ["historian", 1, 1], "3739": ["Paul", 1, 1], "19520": ["Lawrence", 1, 1], "29901": [":", 1, 1], "29923": ["E", 1, 1], "854": ["ven", 1, 1], "2211": ["three", 1, 1], "1602": ["dec", 1, 1], "3076": ["ades", 1, 1], "372": ["it", 1, 1], "9242": ["remains", 1, 1], "412": ["pe", 0, 1], "29916": ["x", 0, 1], "518": ["[", 1, 3], "855": ["St", 0, 1], "29962": ["]", 1, 3], "24498": ["half", 1, 1], "974": ["of", 1, 1], "1552": ["the", 1, 1], "344": ["se", 1, 1], "794": ["vent", 0, 1], "583": ["ies", 1, 1], "26009": ["endeav", 1, 1], "2470": ["ours", 0, 1], "277": ["it", 0, 1], "845": ["sh", 1, 1], "1242": ["ows", 0, 1], "920": ["how", 1, 1], "540": ["he", 1, 1], "9488": ["remained", 1, 1], "697": ["one", 1, 1], "3242": ["most", 1, 1], "5412": ["unique", 1, 1], "2301": ["mus", 1, 1], "14722": ["icians", 1, 1], "12623": ["generation", 1, 1], "1213": [".\"", 0, 1], "12975": ["/\"", 1, 1]}}
{"time_completed": 1741872465, "prefix": "The company's director acquiesced to Tetrazzini's demands, informing Gauthier on opening night that she would not be performing. Rather than give in to artistic blackmail, Gauthier quit opera entirely. Disappointed by her blocked entry into the operatic scene, Gauthier departed Europe and travelled to Java. There, she met a Dutch importer and plantation manager named Frans Knoote. Gauthier and Knoote married on May 22, 1911. Gauthier studied the music of Java, and began to include this in her repertoire. Her accompanying pianist was Paul Seelig, who had previously been the conductor for the Kraton of Surakarta, which afforded Gauthier a number of opportunities. On permission of the Javanese court, she studied the gamelan, probably being the first western woman with a classical music education to be afforded this opportunity. While living in Java, Gauthier travelled extensively, giving performances in China, Japan, Singapore, Malaya, Australia, and New Zealand. She remained in Java for four years, but with the outbreak of World War I she decided to travel back to North America, arriving in New York City in the fall of 1914. Arriving in New York, Gauthier struggled to find a niche in an already crowded music scene. She put on a performance in Vaudeville entitled Songmotion, which combined Javan music with dancers. New York was already home to many North American and European musical performers, so Gauthier focused on her Javan musical repertoire, which she combined with knowledge and skill in modernist western singing. Gauthier began giving annual recitals at Aeolian Hall, and in November 1917 her performance there caught the eye of many leading composers. She developed her own reputation quickly, known as a \"...sensitive purveyor of interesting, untried songs\". She gave renditions of three songs by Maurice Ravel. Her performance then also included American premieres of Stravinsky's Three Japanese Lyrics and Griffes' Five Poems of Ancient China and Japan.", "gold_completion": "The performance was a great success, and she began to receive invitations to perform premieres of songs by contemporary composers. Stravinsky arranged to have Gauthier to premiere all of his vocal pieces. Gauthier travelled to Paris in 1920 at the behest of the Music League of America. Sent there to arrange a tour of North America by Maurice Ravel, she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him, but also with Erik Satie and Les Six. This led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere in concert.", "gen_completion": ["In 1922 Gauthier accepted a position as head of the vocal department of Bennington College. While here, Gauthier gained national recognition as a musician. She helped Bennington students present their graduate recitals. She also frequently accompanied and supported Bennington students at graduate recitals. While Gauthier was a head of the department, Bennington students and graduates such as Paul Taylor and Jean Bennet were students and graduates of Bennington and were supported by Gauthier. As an educator, Gauthier focused on classical singing and on the vocal music and folklore of North Asia. Her pupils included Paul Taylor, Beatrice Swang, Frank Snow and John Milstede. In 1923 Gauthier took a leave of absence from Bennington College. During this period, Gauthier went on tour. She visited numerous European cities, and gave recitals in Italy. She also gave a number of North American concerts. Gauthier came back to Bennington College, but gave a concert one year later. She focused on a number of Asia-influenced songs and operas for this concert. In 1929 Gauthier gave a concert in New York City.

While Deangelo gets annoyed with Jim and Pam, he loves the antics of Andy, who has resorted to physical comedy when his jokes fall flat, getting to the point where he pours hot coffee on his pants and (at Deangelo's urging) eats soap; Andy tells the camera with dazed sadness that \"this is my life now\". Deangelo's popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out peanut butter sandwiches, despite Deangelo's peanut allergy. Deangelo then assembles the staff in the \"multipurpose room\", including Dwight, who learned from Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus snubs Michael. Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is going to go on at the office. Deangelo then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting, saying that he is a good manager and Dunder Mifflin will not be the same without him. The two make up with a reverse hug, Deangelo telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement. Michael returns to his office while Deangelo conducts his meeting in the conference room.

During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, Meridian was home to a Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) office and several other activist organizations. James Chaney and other local residents, along with Michael Schwerner, his wife Rita, and Andrew Goodman, volunteers from New York City, worked to create a community center. They held classes during Freedom Summer to help prepare African Americans in the area to prepare to regain their constitutional franchise, after having been excluded from politics since disenfranchisement in 1890. Whites in the area resented the activism, and physically attacked civil rights workers. In June 1964, Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman went to Neshoba County, Mississippi, to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned. The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian. Following a massive FBI investigation, their murdered bodies were found two months later, buried in an earthen dam. Seven Klansmen, including a deputy sheriff, were convicted by an all-white jury in the federal courthouse in Meridian of \"depriving the victims of their civil rights\". Three defendants were acquitted in the trial for the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner. This was the first time that a white jury had convicted \"a white official in a civil rights killing.\" In 2005, the state brought charges in the case for the first time. Edgar Ray Killen was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 60 years in prison. Meridian later honored Chaney by renaming a portion of 49th Avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service. Starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that made commuting easier, residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north. After strip commercial interests began to move downtown, the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city. The Meridian Historic Districts and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979, and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985. Meridian Main Street organized several projects to revitalize downtown.", "gold_completion": "This included construction of a new Amtrak Station in 1997, based on the design of the historic train station used during Meridian's Golden Age; it had been demolished. Other projects included renovation of the Rosenbaum Building in 2001 and Weidmann's Restaurant in 2002, as well as support for integrated urban design. Meridian Main Street, along with The Riley Foundation, helped renovate and adapt the historic Grand Opera House in 2006 for use as the \"Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts.\"", "gen_completion": ["One group worked on physical preservation and others worked on economic and cultural development. In 2012, Meridian received a $1 million economic development from a federal economic development package. Today, Meridian maintains its position as the largest city and as a major regional and cultural center. It is also a major center for higher education and a number of industrial parks. Although racial tension continued for a number of years following integration and voting rights reform, and despite a 1992 episode involving the brutal beating and near-lynching of two African American youths by a crowd of white youths (the national news reported that 35 out of 40 people involved in the near-lynching were minors), race relations today are improved and substantial racial integration continues. The city is situated on a historic route through what later came to be known as Choctaw Country. At first, this route passed through Meridian as a toll road, where people were assessed for the right to pass through the lands. Later it came through as a military road. In 1913 this road came through as a part of what later came to be known as U.S. Highway 23 (U.S. 23). During World War II, a number of U.S. Army Air Forces units were stationed at various airfields near and around the city.

{"time_completed": 1741876286, "prefix": "Gauthier travelled to Paris in 1920 at the behest of the Music League of America. Sent there to arrange a tour of North America by Maurice Ravel, she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him, but also with Erik Satie and Les Six. This led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere in concert. She accepted and premiered almost all works sent to her, the only exception being a refusal to perform Pierrot Lunaire by Arnold Schoenberg. Through this, Gauthier performed large amounts of contemporary French music across the United States. She also included American music in all of her concerts. Gauthier toured America frequently and returned to Europe in 1922, and again in 1923. She began to explore Jazz music in concert as well, earning her negative reviews by many musical critics. Her 1923 annual performance at Aeolian Hall entitled \"Recital of Ancient and Modern Music for Voice\" became a historic occasion when she presented the works of George Gershwin, the first time his works were performed by a classical singer in concert. The first half of the programme presented works considered serious music at the time. She performed both classical works by Vincenzo Bellini and Henry Purcell, mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, Paul Hindemith, Arnold Schoenberg, Arthur Bliss, Darius Milhaud, Maurice Delage, and Swan Hennessy. The second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment, however. She opened with Alexander's Ragtime Band by Irving Berlin, then performed works by Jerome Kern and Walter Donaldson, and finally finished with three works by George Gershwin: I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise, Innocent Ing\u00e9nue Baby, and Swanee. Gershwin played the piano for these pieces. Important figures in the audience included Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Virgil Thomson, and Paul Whiteman. Although some musical critics panned her decision to include Jazz music, the performance was overall a huge success, and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art. Gauthier continued to present music that was thought poorly of by conservative audiences.", "gold_completion": "On some occasions, such as her performances of Gershwin in New York in 1923 and 1925, as well as in London in 1925, this was quite successful. A critic in Vienna welcomed her musical selection as a reprieve from the usual fare of classical performances - Schubert, Brahms, Wolf, Richard Strauss - while praising her skill with more classical choices. Other performances suffered \u2013 she was booed while performing works by Heitor Villa-Lobos at the Festival of the International Society of Contemporary Music in Venice.", "gen_completion": ["She began performing song recitals for children. She also co-formed a musical company called Pygmalions with French baritone Charles Petignat in 1929. The company focused on performing works with child protagonists. Some included: Petrushka (R. Strauss); The Child Dreams (N. Malko); My Child (V. Sergueyeva); and Poet and Peasant (R. Franz). The company frequently performed for children, and gave benefit recitals for childrens' organisations.\nIn 1932, Gauthier began to release records. Some 15 12\" records were released on Path\u00e9. The songs were from composers including Gershwin, Delage, and Bellini.\nDisease and death[edit]\nIn 1932, Gauthier and Petignat opened a private vocal studio, but found it difficult to get students. Gauthier also found difficulty in winning over the American music critics. This caused tension and disagreement.\nIn 1933, Gauthier toured on a private concert series. The concert series included recitals, Gershwin orchestral works (Rhapsody in Blue and An American in Paris), and works for a children's chorus. She also made a piano concerto debut.

{"time_completed": 1741876879, "prefix": "Originally, the Butterfly Tour was to have a leg in North America. Due to Mariah's project of filming the movie Double-O Soul with Chris Tucker in early 1998, the North American leg was cancelled. However, Double-O Soul ended up not seeing the light of day. The show began with Carey standing on a small elevated centerpiece on stage, surrounded by several long draped curtains. Carey featured three background vocalists throughout the tour, Trey Lorenz, Melodie Daniels and Kelly Price. As the introduction began with \"Emotions\", each of the curtains were slowly draped, revealing Carey atop the platform, dressed in a beige mini-dress and matching sheer blouse and stiletto heels. As she began performing \"Emotions\", the platform was lowered so Carey could access the other sections of the stage throughout the song's performance. After an intimate performance with dimmed lights for \"The Roof (Back in Time)\", Carey was joined on-stage by a Peruvian guitar player, who played the Latin-inspired guitar melodies during her performance of \"My All\". Afterwards, Carey sang \"Close My Eyes\", the only sitting performance of the show. During the song, several male backup dancers performed slow and ample dance routines behind Carey on a higher level of the stage. For the second part of the show, Carey had the second costume change of the evening, donning a long sequined black gown and semi-teased hair. For the performance of \"Dreamlover\", Carey was joined by three female back-up dancers, who mimicked her light dance routines during the song. The next song on the set-list was \"Hero\", which featured Carey alone on-stage, without any vocal back-up. After the song's performance, Carey was joined on-stage by Lorenz, who performed \"I'll Be There\" alongside her. Next came \"Make It Happen\", a song which accompanied yet another wardrobe change for Carey. She donned a short mini-skirt, alongside a sleeveless white blouse and loose golden curls. On-stage, Carey was joined by a full church choir, all dressed in long black garments.", "gold_completion": "After the song's recital, Carey performed \"One Sweet Day\", alongside a previously recorded video of Boyz II Men during their live performance of the song with Carey at Madison Square Garden in 1995. After completing the song, Carey changed to a pair of leg-hugging blue jeans and a tank top. Her next performance was the \"Fantasy\" remix, featuring Ol' Dirty Bastard on a large projection screen behind the stage, as Carey performed light chair dance-routines alongside several male dancers.", "gen_completion": ["The performance of \"Just A Little Bit Of You\" showcased a more sophisticated and dignified Carey. While performing \"Always Be My Baby\", Trey Lorenz performed alongside Carey on-stage. In-between \"Always Be My Baby\" and \"Get It On\" on the set-list came a performance for the male-audience of the show. While wearing another different white and black mini-skirt outfit and a black and white neck-lace, Carey joined a male jazz-band which took over a jazz-piece. The jazz-band took a noticeably larger part during this segment of the show. Including this segment, this song took up about eight to nine minutes of the concert. During the performance of \"Vision Of Love\" and \"When The Night Comes\", Trey Lorenz took on an out-of-character attitude. He started bouncing and moving in front-center and alongside Carey. The screen above-stage showed various colors and a constantly changing background-image. During \"Vision Of Love\" and \"When The Night Comes\", Trey Lorenz acted more-or-less like a go-go boy. For \"Never Forgive Me\" came yet another performance from Lorenz. He took on a much more manly and yet fun-loving attitude. Included in this segment were slideshows from previous albums.

Kong won the bout after slamming Josie back-first into the mat with her signature Awesome Bomb maneuver. A.J. Styles fought Kurt Angle in the sixth encounter of the show next. The match lasted 22 minutes and 44 seconds. Angle was accompanied by Tomko to the ring. The referee forced Tomko to head to the backstage area due to the referee believing he would interfere. Styles attempted to perform his signature Styles Clash maneuver on Angle, which Angle countered into his signature Ankle Lock submission hold. Styles escaped the hold, causing Angle to crash into the referee, knocking him out in the storyline. Karen Angle then ran down to the ringside area and attempted to hand Angle a steel chair. Once Angle grabbed the chair she refused to release, allowing Styles to grab Angle and perform the Styles Clash by slamming Angle face-first into the mat. Styles then followed with the pin attempt to win the contest. After the encounter, Angle and Tomko assaulted Styles. The main event was a King of the Mountain match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship with Kevin Nash as Special Guest Ringside Enforcer between then-champion Samoa Joe and the challengers Booker T, Christian Cage, Rhino, and Robert Roode. In a King of the Mountain match, the objective is to climb a ladder and hang the championship belt on a hook above the ring. In order to do so, a wrestler must first qualify by either pinning or making another wrestler submit in the match. A wrestler who is pinned or made to submit is this placed in a penalty box for two minutes. The match is fought under no disqualification rules. Booker T was the first to qualify by pinning Rhino after slamming him back-first into the mat with his signature Book End maneuver. Rhino was this placed in the penalty box.

Roode attempted to climb the ladder and pull the title from a hook above the ring, but Rhino knocked Roode from a ladder he climbed onto. As Rhino and Roode went at it, Roode pinned Rhino again with a roll-up pin. Rhino attempted a fourth pin on Roode. Roode escaped and held Rhino from climbing another ladder Roode climbed. As Rhino and Roode went at it, Roode pinned Rhino again for a total count of 3 pins. In doing so he also pinned a ringer Roode. This caused Roode to be placed in a penalty box for 2 minutes.

Mount Elbert was named by miners in honor of Samuel Hitt Elbert, the governor of the then-Territory of Colorado, because he brokered a treaty in September 1873 with the Ute tribe that opened up more than of reservation land to mining and railroad activity. The first recorded ascent of the peak was by H.W. Stuckle in 1874, who was surveying the mountain as part of the Hayden Survey. Originally measured as in height, Mount Elbert's elevation was later adjusted to following a re-evaluation of mapped elevations, which sparked protests. The actual change was made in 1988 as a result of the North American Vertical Datum of 1988; it seems the original measurement resulted from the Sea Level Datum of 1929. A matter of some contention arose after the Great Depression over the heights of Elbert and its neighbor Mount Massive, which differ in elevation by only . This led to an ongoing dispute that came to a head with the Mount Massive supporters building large piles of stones on the summit to boost its height, only to have the Mount Elbert proponents demolish them. The effort was ultimately unsuccessful and Mount Elbert has remained the highest peak in Colorado. The first motorized ascent of Elbert occurred in 1949, when a Jeep was driven to the summit, apparently to judge suitability for skiing development. The summit of Mount Elbert is an alpine environment, featuring plants such as Phacelia sericea (sky-pilot), Hymenoxys grandiflora (old-man-of-the-mountain), and Geum rossii (alpine avens).

The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). The attack on ZIPRA in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions. In February 1979, ZIPRA shot down Air Rhodesia Flight 827, another civilian flight, in an almost identical incident. A dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self-governing colony of Rhodesia led the colonial government, headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith, to unilaterally declare independence from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965. The idea of \"no independence before majority rule\" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia's government was dominated by the country's white minority, so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally. Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia. Two rival communist-backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the Chinese-aligned Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), mostly comprising Shonas, created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and adopted aspects of Maoist doctrine, while the Ndebele-dominated Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), aligned with Soviet-style Marxism\u2013Leninism and the Warsaw Pact, mobilised the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the \"Second Chimurenga\" against the Rhodesian government and security forces. The resulting conflict, the Rhodesian Bush War, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia. After the security forces mounted a successful counter-insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974, developments overseas caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the insurgents' favour.", "gold_completion": "The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith's administration, and led to Mozambique's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with ZANU.

Meanwhile a U.S. diplomat attempted to broker a deal for Rhodesian independence; and during 1974 and 1975 a series of conferences took place between Rhodesia and Mozambique over a proposed Rhodesian-Mozambican railway.[43] The \"Samelsson\" plan for Rhodesian independence, initially supported by U.S. diplomat Ralph E.

He declared Rhodesia's intent to \"liquidate the internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism\", and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for \"any defensive strikes we might undertake\" against guerrilla bases in their respective territories. He claimed that the war had escalated because Britain and the United States were supporting the Patriotic Front. William Irvine, the co-Minister of Transport, warned the guerrillas that Rhodesia \"w[ould] not let these innocents go unavenged\". Because ZAPU and ZIPRA were based in Zambia, many Rhodesians clamoured for a massive retaliatory strike against terrorist targets in that country, but the first external target hit by the security forces following the Viscount shootdown was the prominent cluster of ZANLA bases around Chimoio in Mozambique. The Rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in November 1977 during Operation Dingo, destroying much of the ZANLA presence there, but the insurgents had since built a complex called \"New Chimoio\", slightly to the east; the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals.", "gold_completion": "In a combined airborne-ground assault called Operation Snoopy, the Rhodesian Air Force, Rhodesian Light Infantry and Special Air Service wiped out much of New Chimoio on 20 September 1978.

In response, Rhodesia would inform Mozambique that it would be \"treat[ing] Mozambique on a one-for-one basis\" if it decided to go ahead and strike back against Rhodesian terrorist targets. The Rhodesians would first attempt to defend against guerrilla attacks through air strikes on terrorist bases and raids on infrastructure. They had been experimenting with coordinated and simultaneous air and ground operations as a way to intensify their ground efforts; in a two-day period from 11 September 1979 (the day after Rhodesia announced it would begin raiding terrorist bases on a one-for-one basis if Mozambique chose to respond to Rhodesian air raids with its own ground operations), their forces inflicted heavy casualties on two known terrorist bases, \"Mondo\" and \"Witness Tree\" (which"], "too_short": false, "z-score": [6.697263122599658, 4.427188724235731], "wm_pred": [1, 1], "gen_length": [300, 160], "num_green": [208, 108], "are_tokens_green": {"7133": ["During", 1, 1], "278": ["the", 0, 1], "13585": ["bomb", 1, 1], "538": ["ard", 1, 1], "358": ["ment", 0, 1], "310": ["of", 0, 5], "445": ["this", 1, 1], "9867": ["cluster", 0, 1], "22561": ["bases", 1, 4], "29892": [",", 0, 5], "263": ["a", 1, 11], "796": ["Z", 0, 3], "1117": ["amb", 0, 8], "713": ["ian", 1, 4], "13487": ["diplom", 1, 5], "271": ["at", 1, 4], "1058": ["who", 0, 1], "471": ["was", 0, 3], "22618": ["cousin", 1, 1], "423": ["ia", 1, 4], "29915": ["'", 0, 3], "29879": ["s", 1, 3], "7668": ["Minister", 1, 1], "19358": ["Foreign", 0, 1], "26049": ["Affairs", 1, 1], "10322": ["shot", 1, 1], "7123": ["dead", 1, 1], "1550": ["while", 1, 1], "19500": ["driving", 1, 1], "1549": ["through", 1, 2], "18129": ["Moz", 1, 5], "2185": ["ican", 1, 1], "5720": ["village", 1, 1], "29889": [".", 1, 5], "450": ["The", 1, 3], "19716": ["vehicle", 1, 1], "11122": ["contained", 1, 2], "2454": ["atic", 0, 2], "282": ["p", 1, 1], "3222": ["ouch", 0, 1], "607": ["which", 1, 2], "7333": ["personal", 1, 1], "8721": ["letters", 1, 1], "304": ["to", 0, 8], "367": ["be", 1, 2], "4502": ["passed", 1, 1], "373": ["on", 1, 7], "515": ["from", 1, 2], "3942": ["family", 0, 1], "884": ["also", 1, 1], "760": ["part", 1, 1], "7861": ["Rh", 1, 6], "2631": ["odes", 1, 6], "5874": ["government", 1, 1], "14734": ["attempts", 1, 1], "2545": ["bro", 1, 1], "3946": ["ker", 0, 1], "5376": ["deal", 1, 1], "723": ["would", 1, 5], "748": ["go", 1, 2], "934": ["file", 1, 1], "11595": ["formal", 1, 1], "10021": ["protest", 0, 1], "2750": ["against", 1, 3], "1387": ["ique", 0, 4], "512": ["In", 1, 1], "2933": ["response", 1, 1], "1871": ["inform", 0, 1], "393": ["that", 0, 1], "372": ["it", 1, 3], "376": ["\"", 1, 3], "2484": ["tre", 1, 1], "29961": ["[", 1, 1], "292": ["ing", 0, 2], "29962": ["]", 1, 1], "697": ["one", 1, 2], "29899": ["-", 1, 5], "1454": ["for", 0, 2], "650": ["one", 1, 2], "8405": ["basis", 0, 2], "29908": ["\"", 1, 3], "565": ["if", 1, 2], "8459": ["decided", 1, 1], "14432": ["ahead", 1, 1], "322": ["and", 1, 5], "21283": ["strike", 0, 1], "1250": ["back", 0, 1], "15115": ["terror", 1, 4], "391": ["ist", 0, 4], "22525": ["targets", 0, 1], "5834": ["ians", 1, 1], "937": ["first", 1, 1], "4218": ["attempt", 1, 1], "24663": ["defend", 1, 1], "1410": ["gu", 0, 1], "3127": ["err", 0, 1], "2911": ["illa", 1, 1], "16661": ["attacks", 1, 1], "4799": ["air", 1, 3], "19492": ["strik", 0, 1], "267": ["es", 1, 1], "1153": ["ra", 1, 3], "4841": ["ids", 0, 2], "22035": ["infrastr", 0, 1], "12425": ["ucture", 1, 1], "2688": ["They", 1, 1], "750": ["had", 0, 1], "1063": ["been", 1, 1], "7639": ["experiment", 1, 1], "411": ["with", 0, 2], "6615": ["coordin", 1, 1], "630": ["ated", 0, 1], "16991": ["simultane", 0, 1], "681": ["ous", 0, 1], "5962": ["ground", 1, 3], "6931": ["operations", 1, 2], "408": ["as", 1, 1], "982": ["way", 0, 1], "12838": ["intens", 1, 1], "1598": ["ify", 1, 1], "1009": ["their", 1, 2], "14231": ["efforts", 1, 1], "29936": [";", 1, 1], "297": ["in", 0, 1], "1023": ["two", 1, 2], "3250": ["day", 1, 1], "3785": ["period", 1, 1], "29871": ["", 1, 2], "29896": ["1", 1, 3], "3839": ["September", 1, 1], "29929": ["9", 1, 2], "29955": ["7", 0, 1], "313": ["(", 1, 2], "1552": ["the", 1, 1], "2462": ["day", 0, 1], "1156": ["after", 0, 1], "9326": ["announced", 0, 1], "3380": ["begin", 0, 1], "4821": ["iding", 1, 1], "12784": ["chose", 1, 1], "10049": ["respond", 0, 1], "967": ["its", 0, 1], "1914": ["own", 1, 1], "511": ["),", 0, 1], "8249": ["forces", 1, 1], "3041": ["inf", 1, 1], "506": ["lic", 1, 1], "9446": ["ted", 0, 1], "9416": ["heavy", 1, 1], "3209": ["cas", 1, 1], "950": ["ual", 0, 1], "2938": ["ties", 0, 1], "2998": ["known", 1, 1], "29924": ["M", 1, 1], "18592": ["ondo", 1, 1], "29956": ["W", 0, 1], "277": ["it", 0, 1], "2264": ["ness", 1, 1], "15472": ["Tree", 1, 1], "4716": ["which", 1, 1]}}

The RFU, at Hill's instigation, promptly demanded an apology from the Natives' captain of the day, Edward McCausland, who had led the team as Joe Warbrick was injured. The English authorities of the time believed that the decision of a referee was above question, and that protesting a decision as the New Zealanders had done was unsportsmanlike. The RFU threatened to bar any of their affiliated players \u2013 in other words, the entire rugby playing population of England \u2013 from facing the Natives if they did not apologise. McCausland swiftly sent an apology by telegram, but this was deemed inadequate; he therefore sent another, four days after the game: The London establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the New Zealanders' approach to the game; reports of rough and over-aggressive play by the Natives had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in Britain. In the north of England, criticism of the visitors' sportsmanship was rarer; the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents, which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south. Some of the Natives, including Joe Warbrick, accused the RFU and the English press of hypocrisy, claiming that they were quick to criticise the New Zealanders for rough play, yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players. The Natives remained in London following the England international. They defeated London Welsh on 18 February, before losing first to Cambridge, then Oxford University. From there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to Leigh. After a win over Runcorn, there was a defeat to Oldham, played on a ground Eyton said was so frozen it was dangerous. After reversing their previous loss to Halifax with a 6\u20130 win, the Natives suffered a loss to Barrow and District on 7 March.

{"time_completed": 1741880243, "prefix": "As they wrap up the case, Olivia, Peter, and Walter complete forms to finalize their position in the Fringe division. When Peter is out of earshot, Walter learns from Olivia that the FBI medical files on Peter's childhood are void of any details. Co-creators J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, and executive producer Jeff Pinkner wrote the episode. Paul A. Edwards served as the director, his first such credit for the series. In developing Fringe, the co-creators did not want to make the series too serialized, as this was a complaint often directed at Abrams' television series Alias. They wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content, and studied procedural dramas such as Law and Order and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation for inspiration. Kurztman explained, \"While we make sure that our episodes are self-contained \u2013 have a beginning, a middle, and an end \u2013 the character stories can be serialized. They don't have to resolve themselves over the course of one show.\" \"The Same Old Story\" was Fringes first regular episode, and some journalists viewed it as an example of how the series would be structured. The episode was based on actual recent research and involved much collaboration among the series' different departments. For the scene in which they remove the victim's eyeball, the special effects crew created a mold based on actress Elizabeth Stanley's head. Using plaster to make a prosthetic, they \"drilled out the eyeball and sculpt[ed] it open and [went] through a series of molds.\" Stanley stated that \"it's really cool to see the head because it really does look just like me, even though it's very gruesome because the eyeball's popping out.\" The prop department rigged a weapon which they called a \"photon gun\"; according to prop master Peter Gelfman, this gun was based on real devices employed in airport security that look through people's clothing for concealed weapons.", "gold_completion": "VFX Supervisor Christopher Scollard explained that for the eye's last vision, they used \"a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location,\" which they then used to \"take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab.\" \"The Same Old Story\" featured guest appearances by actors Derek Cecil as Christopher Penrose and Mark Blum as his father, Dr. Claus Penrose.", "gen_completion": ["The production team knew before they started on \"The Same Old Story\" that they would \"give Peter\" a headshot gun. Aaron Johnson portrayed Peter and he and Stanley talked about how \"crazy\" and \"whack\" he looks; Stanley also stated \"as soon as [the prop team] found out they were making it they started making it. It wasn't on our shoot. They had it built before we even shot this episode. They were amazing. It took about three hours to build it and they had us a headshot gun before we started shooting. I got about a month-long headshot.\" \"There is a lot of CG [graphics] on the show. A majority of it [is] for effects and stunts. When we shot this episode I never saw the eyeball. I only saw it once and I saw it from a mile away. It was something else. It really is impressive.\"[21] Walter explains some serialized content. The third episode \"Crossing Over\" aired a week later and attracted a larger audience. This episode also focused on Walter and his reconnection to his late wife. However, 1994 Super Bowl champion and NFL MVP Kurt Warner portrayed \"Major\" Charles Kent on \"Crossing Over\".

MI6 agent James Bond infiltrates a North Korean military base where Colonel Tan-Sun Moon is illegally trading weapons for African conflict diamonds. After Moon's right-hand man Zao is contacted by an unknown source who reveals Bond's true identity, Moon attempts to kill Bond and a hovercraft chase ensues, ending with Moon's apparent death. Bond survives but is captured by North Korean soldiers and imprisoned by the Colonel's father, General Moon. After fourteen months of captivity and torture at the hands of the Korean People's Army, Bond is traded for Zao in a prisoner exchange. He is sedated and taken to meet M, who informs him that his status as a 00 Agent has been suspended under suspicion of having leaked information under duress to the North Koreans. Bond is convinced that he has been set up by a double agent in the British government. After escaping MI6 custody, he discovers that he is in Hong Kong, where he learns from Chang, a Chinese agent and old colleague, that Zao is in Cuba. In Havana, Bond meets NSA agent Giacinta \"Jinx\" Johnson. Bond follows her to a gene therapy clinic, where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring. Bond locates Zao inside the clinic and attempts to kill him, but Zao escapes, leaving behind a pendant which leads Bond to a cache of diamonds, identified as conflict diamonds, but bearing the crest of the company owned by British billionaire businessman Gustav Graves. Bond learns that Graves only appeared a year prior, apparently discovering a vein of diamonds in Iceland leading to his current wealth, celebrity, and philanthropy from its assets.

The English authorities of the time believed that the decision of a referee was above question, and that protesting a decision as the New Zealanders had done was unsportsmanlike. The RFU threatened to bar any of their affiliated players \u2013 in other words, the entire rugby playing population of England \u2013 from facing the Natives if they did not apologise. McCausland swiftly sent an apology by telegram, but this was deemed inadequate; he therefore sent another, four days after the game: The London establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the New Zealanders' approach to the game; reports of rough and over-aggressive play by the Natives had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in Britain. In the north of England, criticism of the visitors' sportsmanship was rarer; the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents, which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south. Some of the Natives, including Joe Warbrick, accused the RFU and the English press of hypocrisy, claiming that they were quick to criticise the New Zealanders for rough play, yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players. The Natives remained in London following the England international. They defeated London Welsh on 18 February, before losing first to Cambridge, then Oxford University. From there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to Leigh. After a win over Runcorn, there was a defeat to Oldham, played on a ground Eyton said was so frozen it was dangerous. After reversing their previous loss to Halifax with a 6\u20130 win, the Natives suffered a loss to Barrow and District on 7 March. The New Zealanders then had a run of seven straight wins before a 1\u20131 draw with Hull. Widnes were then defeated for the second time in two weeks in the tourists' last match in northern England.

The authorities and press in London continued to view the team negatively, and the Natives boarded ship without a formal farewell. This perceived affront from the RFU provoked some criticism from the press outside London, as well as from the team manager Scott, who felt that with the team's official apology after the England match, the controversy should have put to rest.

The tourists attracted large and enthusiastic crowds wherever they went and drew from all walks of life. An estimated 25,000 people saw them in the Auckland Domain on 29 March. The New Zealand Rugby Union covered their expenses and some of their profit. The All Blacks are often credited as being the first rugby tour to the Southern Hemisphere. However, a tour led by John \"Jack\" Bickerton had sailed from Sydney on 11 January 1912. This tour was initially sponsored by the Australian Rugby Union but as it wandered through various islands and territories en route they were financially supported and encouraged. The All Blacks tour in 1922-23 was one of the first attempts to sponsor a tour financially. 2022 All blacks will be doing exactly what they did in 1912, a 12 man team led and coached by a couple of professional players will be a learning experience for all involved and will be held together as a team not a conglomeration of a number of clubs. Will it be a success we will never know but we can say as a nation we are really looking forward to this tour.

{"time_completed": 1741881790, "prefix": "Later in the Early Classic a new superstructure was added, with its own masks and decorated panels. During the Hiatus a third stage was built over the earlier constructions, the stairway was demolished and another royal burial, of an unidentified ruler, was set into the structure (Burial 23). While the new pyramid was being built another high ranking tomb (Burial 24) was inserted into the rubble core of the building. The pyramid was then completed, standing tall. The final version of Temple 33 was completely dismantled by archaeologists in 1965 in order to arrive at the earlier stages of construction.Structure 34 is a pyramid in the North Acropolis that was built by Siyaj Chan K'awiil II over the tomb of his father, Yax Nuun Ayiin I. The pyramid was topped by a three chambered shrine, the rooms situated one behind the other.Structure 5D-43 is an unusual radial temple in the East Plaza, built over a pre-existing twin pyramid complex. It is built into the end of the East Plaza Ballcourt and possessed four entry doorways and three stairways, the fourth (south) side was too close to the Central Acropolis for a stairway on that side. The building has a talud-tablero platform profile, modified from the original style found at Teotihuacan. In fact, it has been suggested that the style of the building has closer affinities with El Tajin and Xochicalco than with Teotihuacan itself. The vertical tablero panels are set between sloping talud panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols. Large flower symbols are set into the sloping talud panels, related to the Venus and star symbols used at Teotihuacan. The roof of the structure was decorated with friezes although only fragments now remain, showing a monstrous face, perhaps that of a jaguar, with another head emerging from the mouth. The second head possesses a bifurcated tongue but is probably not that of a snake.", "gold_completion": "The temple, and its associated ballcourt, probably date to the reign of Nuun Ujol Chaak or that of his son Jasaw Chan K'awiil I, in the later part of the 7th century.Structure 5C-49 possesses a clear Teotihuacan-linked architectural style; it has balustrades, an architectural feature that is very rare in the Maya region, and a talud-tablero fa\u00e7ade; it dates to the 4th century AD.", "gen_completion": ["The radial temple was certainly a pyramid, but during later times it received a rectangular shape.

An uptempo dance song, \"Sorry\" was one of the first tracks developed for the album. One remix on the CD maxi single was done by the Pet Shop Boys, featuring added lyrics by the band. The song features a dance groove tempo, and talks about personal empowerment and self-sufficiency. \"Sorry\" received positive reviews from contemporary critics, who declared the track the strongest song on Confessions on a Dance Floor.

In a closing sequence, Madonna led a march and speech at a rally and protest. The clip was directed by Jenniferridge. It received generally mixed reviews.

{"time_completed": 1741883207, "prefix": "\"If there were any parties going on, they'd be tipped off as to where they were.\" Radcliffe first expressed a desire to act at age five, and, aged ten, he made his acting debut in BBC One's televised two-part adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield (1999), portraying the title character as a young boy. Radcliffe made his film debut in The Tailor of Panama (2001), an American film based on John le Carr\u00e9's 1996 spy novel, and a moderate commercial success. In 2000, producer David Heyman asked Radcliffe to audition for the role of Harry Potter for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the best-selling book by British author J. K. Rowling. Rowling had been searching for an unknown British actor to personify the character, and the film's director Chris Columbus recalled thinking, \"This is what I want. This is Harry Potter\" after he saw a video of the young actor in David Copperfield. Eight months later, following several auditions, Radcliffe was selected to play the part. Rowling endorsed the selection, saying: \"I don't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry.\" Radcliffe's parents originally turned down the offer, as they had been told that it would involve six films shot in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. instead offered Radcliffe a two-film contract with shooting in the UK; Radcliffe was unsure at the time if he would act in more than two Harry Potter films. The release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone took place in 2001. Radcliffe received a seven-figure salary for the lead role, but asserted that the fee was \"not that important\" to him; his parents chose to invest the money for him. The film was highly popular and was met with positive reviews, and critics took notice of Radcliffe: \"Radcliffe is the embodiment of every reader's imagination. It is wonderful to see a young hero who is so scholarly looking and filled with curiosity and who connects with very real emotions, from solemn intelligence and the delight of discovery to deep family longing,\" wrote Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle.", "gold_completion": "A year later, Radcliffe starred in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second instalment of the series. Reviewers were positive about the lead actors' performances but had polarising opinions on the film overall. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) was the third film in the series. Radcliffe's performance was criticised by The New York Times film critic A. O. Scott, who felt that co-star Emma Watson had to carry him with her performance.", "gen_completion": ["The release of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets followed later in 2002. Radcliffe noted that while he would have preferred being on location shooting and acting as opposed to working in a studio, he preferred working in the UK. In 2002, Radcliffe began his formal education at Magdalene College, a constituent college of the University of Cambridge. While he continued his acting and his education, he noted how his fame continued to affect his personal life. Radcliffe appeared on The Jerry Seinfeld Show (2002) and Access Granted (2002). However, he noted how working on Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets (2002) helped him; he stated: \"A year and a half ago I would not have been ready. I wouldn't have been ready for it emotionally. I would have been too scared to be a true hero. The camera would have been [making] too much of a difference for [me].\" During a year and a half hiatus from the films, Radcliffe worked on The Tailor of Panama and appeared on stage in a production of Peter and Alice (2003) at The Menier Chocolate Factory.

The route bends to the north and continues along the Delaware River for several miles, crossing into Frenchtown, where the route becomes Trenton Road. Upon entering Frenchtown, an end shield for northbound Route 29 is posted to mark the end of state maintenance, which officially ends at the Washington Street intersection, where maintenance is transferred to the county.

The Natives remained in London following the England international. They defeated London Welsh on 18 February, before losing first to Cambridge, then Oxford University. From there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to Leigh. After a win over Runcorn, there was a defeat to Oldham, played on a ground Eyton said was so frozen it was dangerous. After reversing their previous loss to Halifax with a 6\u20130 win, the Natives suffered a loss to Barrow and District on 7 March. The New Zealanders then had a run of seven straight wins before a 1\u20131 draw with Hull. Widnes were then defeated for the second time in two weeks in the tourists' last match in northern England. The team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in Britain. They eventually played Southern Counties, and beat them 3\u20131. This was their 74th match in the British Isles and their 49th victory. The authorities and press in London continued to view the team negatively, and the Natives boarded ship without a formal farewell. This perceived affront from the RFU provoked some criticism from the press outside London, as well as from the team manager Scott, who felt that with the team's official apology after the England match, the controversy should have put to rest. The majority of the Natives left Plymouth on 29 March (Eyton and Pie Wynyard followed a week later). They arrived in Melbourne in May, where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football, hoping to make more money that way. Although the side had employed Jack Lawlor to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles, the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training. As a result, the Victorian Rules matches were a failure; the players' unfamiliarity with the rules, combined with the fact that most of the Natives were rugby forwards (and therefore less suited to the more open Victorian Rules), ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds.", "gold_completion": "The side played nine Victorian Rules matches in total, including one in New South Wales, but won only three of them, all against relatively weak opposition.

{"time_completed": 1741885858, "prefix": "Some of Churchill's Native American critics, such as Vernon Bellecourt (White Earth Ojibwe) and Suzan Shown Harjo (Southern Cheyenne-Muscogee Creek), argue that his assertion of Native American ancestry without the ability to prove it might constitute misrepresentation and grounds for termination. The University has said that it does not hire on the basis of ethnicity. The University of Colorado's Research Misconduct Committee conducted a preliminary investigation into whether Churchill misrepresented his ethnicity to \"add credibility and public acceptance to his scholarship\". The committee concluded that the allegation was not \"appropriate for further investigation under the definition of research misconduct\". In a 2005 interview in The Rocky Mountain News, Churchill said, \"I have never been confirmed as having one-quarter blood, and never said I was. And even if [the critics] are absolutely right, what does that have to do with this issue? I have never claimed to be goddamned Sitting Bull.\" The longtime indigenous activist Russell Means said in February of that year, \"So I want, from this day forward, every media person nationally, internationally and locally to know that we have ascertained that Ward Churchill is a full-blooded Indian leader.\" Churchill has responded to requests for verification of his asserted Indian heritage in various ways, including attacking the blood quantum upon which some Native American tribes establish their membership requirements. Churchill argues that the United States instituted blood quantum laws based upon rules of descendancy in order to further goals of personal enrichment and political expediency. For decades in his writings, Churchill has argued that blood quantum laws have an inherent genocidal purpose. He says, Set the blood quantum at one-quarter, hold to it as a rigid definition of Indians, let intermarriage proceed as it [has] and eventually Indians will be defined out of existence. Churchill's assertions have been raised as one of the several research-misconduct allegations that were brought against him in 2005 (see below). He has been accused of using his interpretation of the Dawes Act to attack tribal governments that would not recognize him as a member.", "gold_completion": "Churchill has written on American Indian history and culture, and what he describes as the genocide inflicted on the indigenous people of the Americas by European-American settlers and the ongoing repression of native peoples.

I am a human being. I am a human being who lives on this land and whom this land nourishes. I am not just a visitor. I am a co-owner and co-operator and co-creator.\" In the fall 2004 semester, he received three Native American (blood-quantum) enrollments from two different enrollment firms.

{"time_completed": 1741886748, "prefix": "Upsilon Andromedae b (\u03c5 Andromedae b, abbreviated Upsilon And b, \u03c5 And b), formally named Saffar , is an extrasolar planet approximately 44 light-years away from the Sun in the constellation of Andromeda. The planet orbits the solar analog star, Upsilon Andromedae A, approximately every five days. Discovered in June 1996 by Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler, it was one of the first hot Jupiters to be discovered. It is also one of the first non-resolved planets to be detected directly. Upsilon Andromedae b is the innermost known planet in its planetary system. In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Saffar for this planet. The winning name was submitted by the Vega Astronomy Club of Morocco and honours the 11th Century astronomer Ibn al-Saffar of Muslim Spain. Upsilon Andromedae b was detected by the variations in its star's radial velocity caused by the planet's gravity. The variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the Doppler shift of Upsilon Andromedae's spectrum. The planet's existence was announced in January 1997, together with 55 Cancri b and the planet orbiting Tau Bo\u00f6tis. Like 51 Pegasi b, the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star, Upsilon Andromedae b orbits very close to its star, closer than Mercury does to our Sun. The planet takes 4.617 days to complete an orbit, with a semimajor axis of 0.0595 AU.", "gold_completion": "A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Upsilon Andromedae b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found. The true mass may be much greater depending on the inclination of the orbit. A mass of and an inclination of 24\u00b0 were later found using high-resolution spectroscopy. Given the planet's high mass, it is likely that Upsilon Andromedae b is a gas giant with no solid surface.", "gen_completion": ["At this distance, Upsilon Andromedae b is more massive (approximately 2.3 times more massive) than Jupiter. Upsilon Andromedae b is also one of the first exoplanets for which physical parameters (mass and radius) were estimated from direct detection observations. In 1999, Marcy and Butler estimated Upsilon Andromedae b's radius and mass: The planet's radius is 2.3 times larger than Jupiter's (1.23 \u00d7 1011 km, 1.23 \u00d7 1012 km; this compares to 1.32 \u00d7 1011 km for Jupiter, and 1.1 \u00d7 1012 km for Uranus.

The Washington Post said the track is \"a bit oblique lyrically, but the implications are clear in Bono's resolute delivery, Dave (the Edge) Evan's quavering guitar, Adam Clayton's cathedral bass and Larry Mullen's rolling thunder drums\". NME lauded the song as the opening track by saying the album \"starts by spitting furiously\". The publication praised Bono's impassioned singing and The Edge's guitar playing, which transformed the instrument into \"something more than an endlessly abused piece of wood\". The review commented that the \"last ten seconds are breathtakingly beautiful\". The Rocket wrote that the song builds a \"wall of sound\" that Bono's vocals cut through with a \"wail of desperation, as the lyrics agonize the need for personal spirituality\". The reviewer compared the opening riff to Simple Minds' \"Ghostdancing\". Reviewing The Joshua Tree, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the song an \"epic opener\".

It adds features including the ability to use moves from Sonic 2 and Sonic Mania, a challenge mode, a time attack for the first stage, and features from the 3DS rereleases of the game and its sequel. U.S. Gold acquired the rights to make a version of Sonic the Hedgehog for the Amiga, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and Atari ST personal computers, but these went unreleased. Several screenshots exist, some of which resemble the 8-bit version. An enhanced port for the Sega CD was also planned, but was scrapped in favor of Sonic CD. Sonic the Hedgehog was praised by critics, with an 86% rating at the review aggregator GameRankings. It was considered Sega's answer to Nintendo's widely popular Mario series, as it was a platformer featuring the company's mascot.

Frank Ladoire of believed Sonic the Hedgehog was part of a new generation of games that demonstrate that the Genesis is capable of \"beautiful things\" in the technical department. Reviewers praised the colorful, detailed graphics. Rand called its color scheme \"lively, but never garish\", praising the interaction of color with detail in the sprites, backgrounds, and animations and describing its graphics as the best available for the Genesis. Reviewer Boogie Man of GamePro called the intricate backgrounds \"eye-popping\" and \"gorgeous\", which was echoed by Mean Machines. The Lessers (Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk) of Dragon claimed the graphics made Sonic a possible contender for the best game of 1991 and GameZone called the animation \"some of the smoothest and fastest ... ever seen\". Julian Boardman of Raze praised the \"colourful and highly detailed\" backdrops and \"fabulous\" sprites.", "gold_completion": "The music and sound effects were also well received; Dragon called them \"great\", and GameZone \"amazing\".

Critics cited the fast gameplay, unprecedented in platformers. The difficulty was disputed, described as \"impossible\" by Rand and \"average\" by EGM.", "gen_completion": ["Martin Smith of MegaTech similarly described their vibrancy and enthusiastically enjoyed how \"Sega really knows how to do pixel-art right\" as he enjoyed playing as Sonic.

Mean Machine applauded the graphic display and moving colors. Critics described the music as a \"treat\" and \"lively\" while arguing it was \"catchy\" and described the sound effects as \"excellent\" and \"cute\" and \"very annoying\".

In November 1950, Headlam was appointed to take over command of No. 90 (Composite) Wing from Group Captain Paddy Heffernan. Headquartered at RAF Changi, Singapore, No. 90 Wing controlled RAAF units operating during the Malayan Emergency: No. 1 (Bomber) Squadron, flying Avro Lincolns, and No. 38 (Transport) Squadron, flying Douglas C-47 Dakotas. The Lincolns conducted area bombing missions over communist-held territory, as well as strikes against pinpoint targets. The Dakotas were tasked with courier flights, VIP transport and medical evacuations across South East Asia, and in Malaya with airlifting troops and cargo, dropping supplies to friendly forces and despatching propaganda leaflets. Headlam was slightly injured on 20 December, when a No. 38 Squadron Dakota he was co-piloting on a supply drop crash-landed at Kampong Aur in Pahang, following engine failure. In August 1951 he was named commander of RAF Tengah, Singapore, in addition to his post as commanding officer of No. 90 Wing. Headlam handed over command of No. 90 Wing in December 1951. On 19 February 1952, Headlam became senior air staff officer (SASO) at Eastern Area Command in Penrith, New South Wales. During his term as SASO, the RAAF began re-equipping with English Electric Canberra jet bombers and CAC Sabre jet fighters. The Air Force also underwent a major organisational change, as it transitioned from a geographically based command-and-control system to one based on function, resulting in the establishment of Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands. Eastern Area Command, considered a de facto operational headquarters owing to the preponderance of combat units under its control, was reorganised as Home Command in October 1953.

Art exhibitions were originally held in Lamar Hotel in downtown Meridian, but after a name change to Meridian Art Association in 1949, exhibitions were held at various locations around the city. After the Carnegie library at 25th Ave and 7th St was closed, the Art Association remodelled the building into the Meridian Museum of Art to serve as a permanent home for exhibits. The museum was opened in 1970 and has since featured rotating exhibitions as well as many educational programs for both students and adults. Over thirty exhibitions are held annually, ranging from traditional decorative arts to ethnographic and tribal materials, photography, crafts, and many other works of art.

Their intention was to purchase guns which were difficult to trace. Caldwell said it was easy to obtain guns in New Mexico: \"we found it was pretty easy to buy guns. All you had to do was show some identification and it was easy to get.\" Caldwell said she and Stork went to a university library to find the identity \"of someone dying very young\", next went \"to public records and asked for a copy of a birth certificate\" and described how \"we got a rent receipt book and just made up a rent receipt\". \"And then we were able to go to several different gun shops in Albuquerque with those two bits of identification and buy five different guns and bullets,\" said Caldwell. They were able to obtain one Colt .38-caliber revolver, and four Ruger .357-caliber Security-Six Magnum revolvers. The conspirators smuggled the guns into Oregon by packing them in luggage and putting the luggage on a Greyhound Lines bus.

Plans for a limited-access route along the Route 29 corridor go back to 1932, when a parkway was proposed along the Delaware River between Trenton and Lambertville; this proposal never materialized. Plans for a freeway were resurrected in the early 1950s to construct a road, the John Fitch Parkway, that was to run from Hamilton Township to Interstate 95 (now Interstate 295) in Ewing Township. This road was built between 1954 and 1957 from South Warren Street in Trenton to present-day I-295 in Ewing Township. Construction of this portion of the John Fitch Parkway took up much of Trenton\u2019s available waterfront along the Delaware River. The former alignment of Route 29 in the northern part of Trenton and in Ewing Township became Route 175. Between 1990 and 1995, the Route 29 freeway was built between the I-195/I-295 interchange and Route 129 in Hamilton Township. A two-lane street, Lamberton Road, connected the two freeway sections. Plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in Trenton. Construction began in 1997 on the Route 29 freeway between Route 129 and the Morrisville\u2013Trenton Railroad Bridge. The road was to include two traffic lights at Cass Street and South Warren Street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the Delaware River. The tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by 2001 but was delayed after the Army Corps of Engineers discovered many environmental violations that occurred with construction of the tunnel. The roof was put in place in October 2001 and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on March 2, 2002. A restriction to trucks over 13 tons was put in place and made permanent in November 2002. By the 2000s, the state gave the part of Route 29 (South Main Street) between Route 165 and Route 179 in Lambertville to the city, and Route 29 was rerouted to use all of Route 165 and one block of Route 179.

The team read Famitsu to stay informed of what their rivals were doing so they could avoid their mistakes. Sega director Fujio Minegishi had connections to the music industry, and suggested his friend Y\u016bz\u014d Kayama write the Sonic score. However, Sonic Team did not think Kayama's music would fit, and so commissioned Masato Nakamura, bassist and songwriter of the J-pop band Dreams Come True. Nakamura said he was surprised when asked to create the soundtrack, as he had just started with Dreams Come True, but accepted as he was inspired by the team's desire to outperform Nintendo. Nakamura said the hardest part of creating the soundtrack was the number of sounds that could play concurrently: he was limited to four, and said that his lack of knowledge of music on computers made it \"impossible\". He wrote the soundtrack concurrently with the Dreams Come True album Million Kisses. On October 19, 2011, over 20 years after the release, a three-disc compilation of music from Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was released in Japan. The first disc features original tracks from both games, the second contains Nakamura's demo recordings before they were programmed into the Genesis, and the third has songs by Dreams Come True and their associated Akon remixes. Game-package illustrator Akira Watanabe said that his goal was to make the characters \"colorful\", using clear lines and gradation to \"finish them neatly\". According to Watanabe, the developers asked him to create a package design \"similar to pop art ... without being particular to conventional packages\" \u2013 something \"original\" and \"stylish\". The game was not revealed until the January 1991 International Consumer Electronics Show because Sega wanted to wait until the right time and because they saw an opportunity to \"steal the show\".

Prince Sangqudar was the commander-in-chief of the invasion force; his deputies were Vice Governor Taipn, and commander Yagan Tegin. The Mongol armies marched to the border in two columns. One column advanced along the Taping River using over 200 boats; the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the Burmese fort at Ngasaunggyan. The Burmese chronicles report an overwhelming number of Mongol forces laying siege to the fort although their numbers are greatly exaggerated. (The chronicles say that the Burmese army numbered 400,000 men while the Mongol army numbered 20 million men and 6 million horses.) The Burmese withstood the siege for over two months but the fort fell on 3 December 1283. The defeat at Ngasaunggyan broke the back of Burmese defenses. The Burmese army lost several thousand men as well as senior commanders. Kaungsin, the next fort in line, fell just six days later on 9 December 1283. The Mongol sources say that the Burmese lost 10,000 men at Kaungsin. The Mongol armies pushed farther south into the Irrawaddy valley. They took the ancient Burmese capital of Tagaung, about 380 km north of Pagan on 5 February 1284. There, the invaders paused their advance. They found the heat of the searing Irrawaddy valley excessive, and evacuated Tagaung, allowing the Burmese to return to Tagaung on 10 May 1284. But the Mongol army renewed their offensive in the following dry season. They retook Tagaung, and defeated another Burmese stand south of Tagaung, probably near Hanlin, on 26 January 1285, opening the way to Pagan, about 270 km south. After the defeat, the king panicked, and fled to Lower Burma. The evacuation proved premature. The Mongol forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan. The country fell into chaos.", "gold_completion": "In Lower Burma, the king found himself isolated, let alone plan a counterattack.

Without the full support of his sons, the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one. The governor of Pegu revolted that same year. The king managed to send two small expeditions to Pegu but they both failed.", "gen_completion": ["In 1293 Prince Uzana took over Pagan and crowned himself king. In 1292, Uzana took over Upper Burma and crowned himself king. The Northwestern and North-Central zones from 1230s to 1313 were mostly independent from one another. The fall of Upper Burma on 11 June 1313 saw all of Upper Burma and Lower Burma fall under a common ruler for the first time. Burma first came under Mongol Yuan Dynasty ruler direction on 11 June 1313 when Ava fell. The Burmese continued their fight for 33 years before they were totally defeated on 10 July 1317. The invasion and conquest cost about 20 million Mongols lives, and about 1.5 million Burmese lives. The Mongols did not get all the minerals and precious stones they wanted. They moved on; their attention switched to China. They were not really interested in Burma anymore. Burma returned to relative independence. The Mongol forces exited Burma on 12 July 1317. The government and people of Burma came together and their efforts and support saw Burma regain independence on 12 July 1313.
