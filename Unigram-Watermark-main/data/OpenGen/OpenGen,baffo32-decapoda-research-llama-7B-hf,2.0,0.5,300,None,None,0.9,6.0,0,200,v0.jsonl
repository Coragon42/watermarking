Oka's unit of about 650 men attacked the Marines at several locations on the west side of the Lunga perimeter. At about 04:00 on 14 September, two Japanese companies attacked positions held by the 3rd Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment (3/5) near the coast and were thrown back with heavy losses. Another Japanese company captured a small ridge somewhat inland but was then pinned down by Marine artillery fire throughout the day and took heavy losses before withdrawing on the evening of 14 September. The rest of Oka's unit failed to find the Marine lines and did not participate in the attack. At 13:05 on 14 September, Kawaguchi led the survivors of his shattered brigade away from the ridge and deeper into the jungle, where they rested and tended to their wounded all the next day. Kawaguchi's units were then ordered to withdraw west to the Matanikau River valley to join with Oka's unit, a march over difficult terrain. Kawaguchi's troops began the march on the morning of 16 September. Almost every soldier able to walk had to help carry the wounded. As the march progressed, the exhausted and hungry soldiers, who had eaten their last rations on the morning before their withdrawal, began to discard their heavy equipment and then their rifles. By the time most of them reached Oka's positions at Kokumbona five days later, only half still carried their weapons.

{"time_completed": 1741869641, "prefix": "The mountains lie within the Basin and Range Province or Great Basin of the Western United States, which is characterized by a series of parallel fault blocks that form long north\u2013south mountain ranges separated by wide, high-desert valleys. The Trout Creek Mountains are uplifted and tilted blocks with steep escarpments along the southern and eastern sides of the range. The southern area of the range, known as The Granites, has numerous outcroppings of Cretaceous age granite. These granite outcrops are commonly found in the eroded valleys below the volcanic ridgelines. The Trout Creek Mountains are composed mostly of basalt from a shield volcano that once stood where Steens Mountain is today. Crustal thinning and the Yellowstone hotspot, which was then beneath southeastern Oregon, induced eruptions from Steens and nearby vents about 17 million years ago, in the Miocene. The vents produced a series of lava flows that spread across the land now known as the Trout Creek Mountains. Eruptions from the Steens volcano lasted for about one million years, and at least 70 separate lava flows occurred. Under the resulting basalt rock lie much older metamorphic rocks that may be related to some of the Triassic age formations of the Blue Mountains in northeastern Oregon. Within these metamorphic rocks are diorite and granodiorite intrusive bodies which were presumably intruded during the Cretaceous Period. The broad McDermitt Caldera is a prominent geologic feature in the Trout Creek Mountains. The oval-shaped caldera is a collapsed lava dome that straddles the Oregon\u2013Nevada border on the eastern side of the range and south of the Oregon Canyon Mountains. It is about long and wide. The lava dome was created by volcanic eruptions in the early Miocene. A total of five large ash flows were produced along with a large rhyolite dome structure. The caldera formed when the dome collapsed about 16 million years ago.", "gold_completion": "The caldera contains significant ore deposits, and mercury and uranium have been mined at eight or more sites in and around the caldera. Other areas in the caldera were mined for ores of antimony, cesium, and lithium. The Trout Creek Mountains are semi-arid because they are in the eastern rain shadow of mountain ranges to the west. When moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward over the Oregon and California coastal ranges and the Cascade Range, most precipitation falls in those mountains before reaching the Trout Creek Mountains.", "gen_completion": ["In most areas of the volcanic ridgeline, the lava dome rocks are exposed. In a few areas, including nearby Fremont Peak and Steens Mountain, thin sedimentary rocks and some volcanic rocks lie on top. The post-Miocene sedimentary and volcanic rocks are part of the Haggart Mountain Member, which lies beneath Fremont Peak and McDermitt Caldera. The sediments were probably deposited along the eastern margin of a rift valley. Fremont Peak and McDermitt Caldera are post-Miocene basalt volcanic centers. Some of these volcanic centers are now a part of a series of volcanic cones which have been built along the western edge of the Steens Mountain Range. The Steens Mountain Range volcanic cones are mainly basalt andesite volcanic rocks, and they are tilted up about 22 degrees. The Miocene volcanism continued for about 3 million years and created a series of volcanic cones and calderas along the western part of the Steens Mountain Range. Volcanism continued with smaller calderas. The tilted volcanic rocks of Steens Mountain are exposed where the newer sediments are removed from the volcanic cones.

In the latter position, he was influential in securing two large military training posts for Kentucky: Camp Zachary Taylor and Fort Knox. Though Camp Zachary Taylor was abandoned after World War I, Fort Knox became the home of the US Bullion Depository. After the United States entered World War I, Beckham continued to back Wilson and later supported the League of Nations. True to his prohibitionist stance, Beckham supported passage of the Eighteenth Amendment, which enacted Prohibition in the United States. The amendment was ratified and became effective in January 1920. Believing that women should be protected from involvement in politics, Beckham opposed the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women's suffrage. The amendment failed on February 10, 1919 but passed on June 4, 1919. Beckham voted against it both times. The Democrats renominated Beckham without opposition in 1920. His opponent in the general election was Republican Richard P. Ernst. Prohibition had destroyed the distilling industry and the saloon business in the state, and in areas that those industries were prominent, Beckham received more than 5,000 fewer votes than Democratic presidential nominee James M. Cox. He was also hurt by the women's vote and by his support of Wilson, who had lost popularity since Beckham's election, in 1914. Ernst won the election by fewer than 5,000 votes, winning the race with 50.3% of the vote to Beckham's 49.7&%. During his only term in the Senate, Beckham served alongside three other US Senators from Kentucky: Ollie M. James, George B. Martin, and Augustus O. Stanley. After his term in the Senate ended, Beckham resumed his legal practice in Louisville. He sought another term as governor in 1927. This time, he had the support of the Louisville Courier-Journal, which had been purchased by his ally, Robert W. Bingham. He was opposed by a powerful political machine, known as the Jockey Club, whose main interest was securing legislation to allow parimutuel betting at the state's horse racetracks.", "gold_completion": "The Jockey Club ran a candidate in both parties' primary elections.

Fields, who had been elected with the help of the Jockey Club.", "gen_completion": ["While seeking this legislation, however, which would be detrimental to Kentucky's interests as Beckham saw it, and which would bring Gov. A.B. \"Happy\" Chandler into office (whose election would mark the end of Beckham's government), he was opposed for another term as governor by the Republican majority. In 1929, Beckham resigned from his chairmanship of the Kentucky Liquor Commission. The distillery industry had nearly disappeared and saloons were closing as a result of prohibition. A cooperative marketing plan had been developed which would have helped distilleries and saloons return to their former positions. However, opposition from the Republican majority in the state legislature resulted in Beckham's resignation and Republican James A. Blair succeeded him as chairman.

Seven Klansmen, including a deputy sheriff, were convicted by an all-white jury in the federal courthouse in Meridian of \"depriving the victims of their civil rights\". Three defendants were acquitted in the trial for the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner. This was the first time that a white jury had convicted \"a white official in a civil rights killing.\" In 2005, the state brought charges in the case for the first time. Edgar Ray Killen was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 60 years in prison. Meridian later honored Chaney by renaming a portion of 49th Avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service. Starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that made commuting easier, residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north. After strip commercial interests began to move downtown, the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city. The Meridian Historic Districts and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979, and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985. Meridian Main Street organized several projects to revitalize downtown. This included construction of a new Amtrak Station in 1997, based on the design of the historic train station used during Meridian's Golden Age; it had been demolished. Other projects included renovation of the Rosenbaum Building in 2001 and Weidmann's Restaurant in 2002, as well as support for integrated urban design. Meridian Main Street, along with The Riley Foundation, helped renovate and adapt the historic Grand Opera House in 2006 for use as the \"Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts.\" After ownership of the Meridian Main Street was transferred to the Alliance for Downtown Meridian in late 2007, the two organizations, along with the Meridian Downtown Association, spearheaded the downtown revitalization effort. The Alliance serves as an umbrella organization, allowing the other two organizations to use its support staff and housing, and in turn the Alliance serves as a liaison between the organizations. Plans were underway to renovate the Threefoot Building, but newly elected Mayor Cheri Barry killed the plans in early 2010.", "gold_completion": "Today, the Alliance helps to promote further development and restoration downtown; its goal is to assist businesses such as specialty shops, restaurants, and bars because these help downtown become more active during the day and at night. The Meridian Downtown Association is primarily focused on increasing foot traffic downtown by organizing special events, and the Meridian Main Street program supports existing businesses downtown. Given Meridian's site as a railroad junction, its travelers have attracted the development of many hotels.

The 2012 renovation plan includes renovation and reconstruction of some portions of the Threefoot Building. In 2013, a \"hybrid\" plan for renovation of the Threefoot Building was developed. In 2014, plans for renovation were abandoned again. The Riley Center has been used as a concert and performance venue for over a decade, and recently became used as a private club, membership which can be obtained from a downtown business. On September 21, 2012 a dedication ceremony for a statue honoring James Meridian was held in front of City Hall. The ceremony included a baton pass to a group including Governor Phil Bryant and former Mayor Charles Perkins. In 2012, while renovation plans were abandoned again for the Threefoot Building, plans were developed for renovation and reconstruction for a large part of it. A ground-breaking ceremony for a combined arts and cultural center and conference center for the Threefoot Building was held on October 21, 2013.

{"time_completed": 1741871613, "prefix": "When tailoring his 1970 composition \"I'm the Greatest\" for Starr to record on the 1973 album Ringo, Lennon referenced the song title with the lines \"Now I'm only thirty-two / And all I want to do is boogaloo\". Having earmarked the song as his next single, Starr recorded \"Back Off Boogaloo\" in September 1971, following his appearance at the Harrison-organised Concert for Bangladesh in New York. The sessions took place at Apple Studio in central London, with Harrison producing, as he had on \"It Don't Come Easy\". The recording reflects the influence of glam rock on Starr through what authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter term \"its big drum sound and repetitious nature\". The line-up comprised Starr (vocals, drums, percussion), Harrison (guitars), Gary Wright (piano) and Klaus Voormann (bass, saxophone). Rodriguez describes Starr's \"martial-sounding opening\" as a rare \"showcase for his own drumming\", while Harrison biographer Simon Leng writes of \"a roaring series of Harrison slide breaks that brought to mind Duane Allman\". Starr later said that he incorporated a hook he had come up with for the Beatles song \"Get Back\" into his drum part on \"Back Off Boogaloo\". Further overdubs on the track included contributions from three backing vocalists, led by American soul singer Madeline Bell. For the single's B-side, Starr had already written and recorded \"Blindman\". It was intended to be the theme song for the Ferdinando Baldi-directed Spaghetti Western Blindman, filming for which Starr had interrupted in order to perform at the Concert for Bangladesh. The song was passed over for inclusion in the film, since producer Tony Anthony favoured an original score by Stelvio Cipriani. Starr produced the track with Voormann.", "gold_completion": "The recording sessions took place at Apple on 18\u201319 August, with Badfinger guitarist Pete Ham assisting Starr and Voormann. Like the film, \"Blindman\" was not held in high regard by critics. Spizer describes it as \"a muddy-sounding dirge with little to recommend\". By contrast, director and author Alex Cox believes that the song \"works well, in the context of the film\" compared to Cipriani's score, which he considers \"lazy\".", "gen_completion": ["Its sleeve on the album shows Starr holding a gun over a dead man as his colleague and their dog stand and look on. The album version begins with a John Lennon-sounding harmonica, which was overdubbed while Ringo was away on location. The instrumental mixes and reversals also mirror what Starr and Harrison would later achieve on The Beatles' own \"Revolution 9\". Author Ian MacDonald writes of \"Blindman\" being \"nothing more\" than \"a short western melody with subtly off-kilter harmonica and a slide guitar part\". The song found favour with radio stations as a standalone 45-rpm single release. When the song first aired on WLS-Chicago, the radio station received hundreds of letters from listeners. Apart from television appearances, including a repeat on the American music series The Andy Williams Show, \"Back Off Boogaloo\" and \"Blindman\" were promoted on the radio through Ringo. In his opinion on the single, music historian Paul Mac Lawrence writes: \"Even three decades later, it remains the apex of [Starr]'s first-half-of-the-seventies endeavours\" and \"it [shows] how he remained one of the [most] unique musicians of his generation.\" The song \"Back Off Boogaloo\"/\"Blindman\""], "too_short": false, "z-score": [7.159143337951359, 5.865884600854132], "wm_pred": [1, 1], "gen_length": [300, 186], "num_green": [212, 133], "are_tokens_green": {"8011": ["Its", 1, 1], "12844": ["sle", 1, 1], "29872": ["e", 0, 1], "345": ["ve", 0, 1], "373": ["on", 1, 8], "278": ["the", 0, 8], "3769": ["album", 1, 2], "3697": ["shows", 1, 1], "624": ["St", 0, 2], "2749": ["arr", 1, 3], "13587": ["holding", 1, 1], "263": ["a", 1, 8], "13736": ["gun", 1, 1], "975": ["over", 1, 2], "7123": ["dead", 1, 1], "767": ["man", 1, 1], "408": ["as", 1, 2], "670": ["his", 1, 3], "23056": ["colle", 1, 1], "3437": ["ague", 1, 1], "322": ["and", 1, 7], "1009": ["their", 1, 1], "11203": ["dog", 1, 1], "2317": ["stand", 1, 2], "1106": ["look", 0, 1], "29889": [".", 1, 5], "450": ["The", 1, 6], "1873": ["version", 1, 1], "16410": ["begins", 1, 1], "411": ["with", 0, 3], "2259": ["John", 1, 1], "365": ["L", 0, 1], "2108": ["enn", 0, 1], "265": ["on", 0, 1], "29899": ["-", 1, 8], "29879": ["s", 1, 2], "12449": ["ounding", 1, 1], "10311": ["harm", 1, 2], "26082": ["onica", 1, 2], "29892": [",", 0, 6], "607": ["which", 1, 1], "471": ["was", 0, 2], "29881": ["d", 0, 1], "431": ["ub", 0, 1], "2580": ["bed", 0, 1], "1550": ["while", 1, 1], "17716": ["Ring", 1, 2], "29877": ["o", 1, 2], "3448": ["away", 1, 1], "4423": ["location", 1, 1], "11395": ["instrument", 1, 1], "284": ["al", 0, 3], "6837": ["mix", 1, 1], "267": ["es", 1, 1], "18764": ["revers", 1, 1], "1338": ["als", 1, 1], "884": ["also", 1, 1], "19571": ["mirror", 1, 1], "825": ["what", 1, 1], "26954": ["Harrison", 1, 1], "723": ["would", 1, 1], "2678": ["later", 1, 2], "6176": ["achieve", 1, 1], "18573": ["Beat", 0, 1], "793": ["les", 1, 1], "29915": ["'", 0, 2], "1914": ["own", 1, 1], "376": ["\"", 1, 9], "1123": ["Re", 1, 1], "4068": ["volution", 1, 1], "29871": ["", 1, 2], "29929": ["9", 1, 1], "1642": ["\".", 0, 2], "13361": ["Author", 1, 1], "22291": ["Ian", 1, 1], "4326": ["Mac", 0, 2], "28080": ["Donald", 0, 1], "15873": ["writes", 1, 2], "310": ["of", 0, 5], "10358": ["Bl", 0, 3], "513": ["ind", 0, 3], "1171": ["man", 0, 3], "29908": ["\"", 1, 7], "1641": ["being", 1, 1], "28450": ["nothing", 1, 1], "901": ["more", 1, 1], "1135": ["than", 0, 1], "29874": ["a", 1, 1], "3273": ["short", 1, 1], "15782": ["western", 1, 1], "9232": ["mel", 0, 1], "1486": ["ody", 1, 1], "12059": ["subt", 1, 1], "368": ["ly", 0, 1], "1283": ["off", 0, 1], "16757": ["kil", 1, 1], "357": ["ter", 0, 1], "20343": ["slide", 1, 1], "11210": ["guitar", 1, 1], "760": ["part", 1, 1], "4823": ["song", 1, 3], "1476": ["found", 1, 1], "15381": ["favour", 1, 1], "7155": ["radio", 1, 3], "16355": ["stations", 1, 1], "18785": ["alone", 0, 1], "29946": ["4", 0, 1], "29945": ["5", 0, 1], "29878": ["r", 1, 1], "3358": ["pm", 0, 1], "2323": ["single", 0, 2], "6507": ["release", 1, 1], "1932": ["When", 1, 1], "937": ["first", 1, 2], "2859": ["ired", 0, 1], "399": ["W", 0, 1], "8547": ["LS", 1, 1], "1451": ["Ch", 1, 1], "9384": ["icago", 1, 1], "5073": ["station", 1, 1], "4520": ["received", 1, 1], "21006": ["hundreds", 1, 1], "8721": ["letters", 1, 1], "515": ["from", 1, 2], "11621": ["listen", 1, 1], "414": ["ers", 0, 1], "319": ["A", 1, 1], "1595": ["part", 0, 1], "11456": ["television", 1, 1], "21712": ["appearances", 1, 1], "3704": ["including", 1, 1], "12312": ["repeat", 0, 1], "3082": ["American", 1, 1], "4696": ["music", 1, 2], "3652": ["series", 1, 1], "21828": ["Andy", 1, 1], "11648": ["Williams", 0, 1], "7704": ["Show", 0, 1], "5841": ["Back", 0, 2], "5947": ["Off", 1, 2], "1952": ["Bo", 0, 2], "468": ["og", 1, 2], "3634": ["oo", 0, 2], "892": ["were", 1, 1], "21201": ["promoted", 0, 1], "1549": ["through", 1, 1], "512": ["In", 1, 1], "9426": ["opinion", 1, 1], "27629": ["historian", 1, 1], "3739": ["Paul", 1, 1], "19520": ["Lawrence", 1, 1], "29901": [":", 1, 1], "29923": ["E", 1, 1], "854": ["ven", 1, 1], "2211": ["three", 1, 1], "1602": ["dec", 1, 1], "3076": ["ades", 1, 1], "372": ["it", 1, 1], "9242": ["remains", 1, 1], "412": ["pe", 0, 1], "29916": ["x", 0, 1], "518": ["[", 1, 3], "855": ["St", 0, 1], "29962": ["]", 1, 3], "24498": ["half", 1, 1], "974": ["of", 1, 1], "1552": ["the", 1, 1], "344": ["se", 1, 1], "794": ["vent", 0, 1], "583": ["ies", 1, 1], "26009": ["endeav", 1, 1], "2470": ["ours", 0, 1], "277": ["it", 0, 1], "845": ["sh", 1, 1], "1242": ["ows", 0, 1], "920": ["how", 1, 1], "540": ["he", 1, 1], "9488": ["remained", 1, 1], "697": ["one", 1, 1], "3242": ["most", 1, 1], "5412": ["unique", 1, 1], "2301": ["mus", 1, 1], "14722": ["icians", 1, 1], "12623": ["generation", 1, 1], "1213": [".\"", 0, 1], "12975": ["/\"", 1, 1]}}
{"time_completed": 1741872465, "prefix": "The company's director acquiesced to Tetrazzini's demands, informing Gauthier on opening night that she would not be performing. Rather than give in to artistic blackmail, Gauthier quit opera entirely. Disappointed by her blocked entry into the operatic scene, Gauthier departed Europe and travelled to Java. There, she met a Dutch importer and plantation manager named Frans Knoote. Gauthier and Knoote married on May 22, 1911. Gauthier studied the music of Java, and began to include this in her repertoire. Her accompanying pianist was Paul Seelig, who had previously been the conductor for the Kraton of Surakarta, which afforded Gauthier a number of opportunities. On permission of the Javanese court, she studied the gamelan, probably being the first western woman with a classical music education to be afforded this opportunity. While living in Java, Gauthier travelled extensively, giving performances in China, Japan, Singapore, Malaya, Australia, and New Zealand. She remained in Java for four years, but with the outbreak of World War I she decided to travel back to North America, arriving in New York City in the fall of 1914. Arriving in New York, Gauthier struggled to find a niche in an already crowded music scene. She put on a performance in Vaudeville entitled Songmotion, which combined Javan music with dancers. New York was already home to many North American and European musical performers, so Gauthier focused on her Javan musical repertoire, which she combined with knowledge and skill in modernist western singing. Gauthier began giving annual recitals at Aeolian Hall, and in November 1917 her performance there caught the eye of many leading composers. She developed her own reputation quickly, known as a \"...sensitive purveyor of interesting, untried songs\". She gave renditions of three songs by Maurice Ravel. Her performance then also included American premieres of Stravinsky's Three Japanese Lyrics and Griffes' Five Poems of Ancient China and Japan.", "gold_completion": "The performance was a great success, and she began to receive invitations to perform premieres of songs by contemporary composers. Stravinsky arranged to have Gauthier to premiere all of his vocal pieces. Gauthier travelled to Paris in 1920 at the behest of the Music League of America. Sent there to arrange a tour of North America by Maurice Ravel, she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him, but also with Erik Satie and Les Six. This led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere in concert.", "gen_completion": ["In 1922 Gauthier accepted a position as head of the vocal department of Bennington College. While here, Gauthier gained national recognition as a musician. She helped Bennington students present their graduate recitals. She also frequently accompanied and supported Bennington students at graduate recitals. While Gauthier was a head of the department, Bennington students and graduates such as Paul Taylor and Jean Bennet were students and graduates of Bennington and were supported by Gauthier. As an educator, Gauthier focused on classical singing and on the vocal music and folklore of North Asia. Her pupils included Paul Taylor, Beatrice Swang, Frank Snow and John Milstede. In 1923 Gauthier took a leave of absence from Bennington College. During this period, Gauthier went on tour. She visited numerous European cities, and gave recitals in Italy. She also gave a number of North American concerts. Gauthier came back to Bennington College, but gave a concert one year later. She focused on a number of Asia-influenced songs and operas for this concert. In 1929 Gauthier gave a concert in New York City.

While Deangelo gets annoyed with Jim and Pam, he loves the antics of Andy, who has resorted to physical comedy when his jokes fall flat, getting to the point where he pours hot coffee on his pants and (at Deangelo's urging) eats soap; Andy tells the camera with dazed sadness that \"this is my life now\". Deangelo's popularity with the employees causes Michael to get jealous to the point where he passes out peanut butter sandwiches, despite Deangelo's peanut allergy. Deangelo then assembles the staff in the \"multipurpose room\", including Dwight, who learned from Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) that Michael did not put in a recommendation and thus snubs Michael. Jim quietly tells Michael that he chose to resign his job and needs to come to terms with both that choice and the fact that life is going to go on at the office. Deangelo then steps out of his meeting and asks Michael for advice for how to run the meeting, saying that he is a good manager and Dunder Mifflin will not be the same without him. The two make up with a reverse hug, Deangelo telling him that he should start enjoying his retirement. Michael returns to his office while Deangelo conducts his meeting in the conference room.

During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, Meridian was home to a Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) office and several other activist organizations. James Chaney and other local residents, along with Michael Schwerner, his wife Rita, and Andrew Goodman, volunteers from New York City, worked to create a community center. They held classes during Freedom Summer to help prepare African Americans in the area to prepare to regain their constitutional franchise, after having been excluded from politics since disenfranchisement in 1890. Whites in the area resented the activism, and physically attacked civil rights workers. In June 1964, Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman went to Neshoba County, Mississippi, to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned. The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian. Following a massive FBI investigation, their murdered bodies were found two months later, buried in an earthen dam. Seven Klansmen, including a deputy sheriff, were convicted by an all-white jury in the federal courthouse in Meridian of \"depriving the victims of their civil rights\". Three defendants were acquitted in the trial for the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner. This was the first time that a white jury had convicted \"a white official in a civil rights killing.\" In 2005, the state brought charges in the case for the first time. Edgar Ray Killen was convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 60 years in prison. Meridian later honored Chaney by renaming a portion of 49th Avenue after him and holding an annual memorial service. Starting in the 1960s and following the construction of highways that made commuting easier, residents began to move away from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north. After strip commercial interests began to move downtown, the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city. The Meridian Historic Districts and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979, and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985. Meridian Main Street organized several projects to revitalize downtown.", "gold_completion": "This included construction of a new Amtrak Station in 1997, based on the design of the historic train station used during Meridian's Golden Age; it had been demolished. Other projects included renovation of the Rosenbaum Building in 2001 and Weidmann's Restaurant in 2002, as well as support for integrated urban design. Meridian Main Street, along with The Riley Foundation, helped renovate and adapt the historic Grand Opera House in 2006 for use as the \"Mississippi State University Riley Center for Education and the Performing Arts.\"", "gen_completion": ["One group worked on physical preservation and others worked on economic and cultural development. In 2012, Meridian received a $1 million economic development from a federal economic development package. Today, Meridian maintains its position as the largest city and as a major regional and cultural center. It is also a major center for higher education and a number of industrial parks. Although racial tension continued for a number of years following integration and voting rights reform, and despite a 1992 episode involving the brutal beating and near-lynching of two African American youths by a crowd of white youths (the national news reported that 35 out of 40 people involved in the near-lynching were minors), race relations today are improved and substantial racial integration continues. The city is situated on a historic route through what later came to be known as Choctaw Country. At first, this route passed through Meridian as a toll road, where people were assessed for the right to pass through the lands. Later it came through as a military road. In 1913 this road came through as a part of what later came to be known as U.S. Highway 23 (U.S. 23). During World War II, a number of U.S. Army Air Forces units were stationed at various airfields near and around the city.

{"time_completed": 1741876286, "prefix": "Gauthier travelled to Paris in 1920 at the behest of the Music League of America. Sent there to arrange a tour of North America by Maurice Ravel, she struck up a friendship and professional correspondence not only with him, but also with Erik Satie and Les Six. This led to more music being sent to her by various composers that she would premiere in concert. She accepted and premiered almost all works sent to her, the only exception being a refusal to perform Pierrot Lunaire by Arnold Schoenberg. Through this, Gauthier performed large amounts of contemporary French music across the United States. She also included American music in all of her concerts. Gauthier toured America frequently and returned to Europe in 1922, and again in 1923. She began to explore Jazz music in concert as well, earning her negative reviews by many musical critics. Her 1923 annual performance at Aeolian Hall entitled \"Recital of Ancient and Modern Music for Voice\" became a historic occasion when she presented the works of George Gershwin, the first time his works were performed by a classical singer in concert. The first half of the programme presented works considered serious music at the time. She performed both classical works by Vincenzo Bellini and Henry Purcell, mixing them with modernist and neoclassical works by B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k, Paul Hindemith, Arnold Schoenberg, Arthur Bliss, Darius Milhaud, Maurice Delage, and Swan Hennessy. The second half of her performance would upset the musical establishment, however. She opened with Alexander's Ragtime Band by Irving Berlin, then performed works by Jerome Kern and Walter Donaldson, and finally finished with three works by George Gershwin: I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise, Innocent Ing\u00e9nue Baby, and Swanee. Gershwin played the piano for these pieces. Important figures in the audience included Ernestine Schumann-Heink, Virgil Thomson, and Paul Whiteman. Although some musical critics panned her decision to include Jazz music, the performance was overall a huge success, and provoked serious discussion among conservative audiences whether jazz music could be considered serious art. Gauthier continued to present music that was thought poorly of by conservative audiences.", "gold_completion": "On some occasions, such as her performances of Gershwin in New York in 1923 and 1925, as well as in London in 1925, this was quite successful. A critic in Vienna welcomed her musical selection as a reprieve from the usual fare of classical performances - Schubert, Brahms, Wolf, Richard Strauss - while praising her skill with more classical choices. Other performances suffered \u2013 she was booed while performing works by Heitor Villa-Lobos at the Festival of the International Society of Contemporary Music in Venice.", "gen_completion": ["She began performing song recitals for children. She also co-formed a musical company called Pygmalions with French baritone Charles Petignat in 1929. The company focused on performing works with child protagonists. Some included: Petrushka (R. Strauss); The Child Dreams (N. Malko); My Child (V. Sergueyeva); and Poet and Peasant (R. Franz). The company frequently performed for children, and gave benefit recitals for childrens' organisations.\nIn 1932, Gauthier began to release records. Some 15 12\" records were released on Path\u00e9. The songs were from composers including Gershwin, Delage, and Bellini.\nDisease and death[edit]\nIn 1932, Gauthier and Petignat opened a private vocal studio, but found it difficult to get students. Gauthier also found difficulty in winning over the American music critics. This caused tension and disagreement.\nIn 1933, Gauthier toured on a private concert series. The concert series included recitals, Gershwin orchestral works (Rhapsody in Blue and An American in Paris), and works for a children's chorus. She also made a piano concerto debut.

{"time_completed": 1741876879, "prefix": "Originally, the Butterfly Tour was to have a leg in North America. Due to Mariah's project of filming the movie Double-O Soul with Chris Tucker in early 1998, the North American leg was cancelled. However, Double-O Soul ended up not seeing the light of day. The show began with Carey standing on a small elevated centerpiece on stage, surrounded by several long draped curtains. Carey featured three background vocalists throughout the tour, Trey Lorenz, Melodie Daniels and Kelly Price. As the introduction began with \"Emotions\", each of the curtains were slowly draped, revealing Carey atop the platform, dressed in a beige mini-dress and matching sheer blouse and stiletto heels. As she began performing \"Emotions\", the platform was lowered so Carey could access the other sections of the stage throughout the song's performance. After an intimate performance with dimmed lights for \"The Roof (Back in Time)\", Carey was joined on-stage by a Peruvian guitar player, who played the Latin-inspired guitar melodies during her performance of \"My All\". Afterwards, Carey sang \"Close My Eyes\", the only sitting performance of the show. During the song, several male backup dancers performed slow and ample dance routines behind Carey on a higher level of the stage. For the second part of the show, Carey had the second costume change of the evening, donning a long sequined black gown and semi-teased hair. For the performance of \"Dreamlover\", Carey was joined by three female back-up dancers, who mimicked her light dance routines during the song. The next song on the set-list was \"Hero\", which featured Carey alone on-stage, without any vocal back-up. After the song's performance, Carey was joined on-stage by Lorenz, who performed \"I'll Be There\" alongside her. Next came \"Make It Happen\", a song which accompanied yet another wardrobe change for Carey. She donned a short mini-skirt, alongside a sleeveless white blouse and loose golden curls. On-stage, Carey was joined by a full church choir, all dressed in long black garments.", "gold_completion": "After the song's recital, Carey performed \"One Sweet Day\", alongside a previously recorded video of Boyz II Men during their live performance of the song with Carey at Madison Square Garden in 1995. After completing the song, Carey changed to a pair of leg-hugging blue jeans and a tank top. Her next performance was the \"Fantasy\" remix, featuring Ol' Dirty Bastard on a large projection screen behind the stage, as Carey performed light chair dance-routines alongside several male dancers.", "gen_completion": ["The performance of \"Just A Little Bit Of You\" showcased a more sophisticated and dignified Carey. While performing \"Always Be My Baby\", Trey Lorenz performed alongside Carey on-stage. In-between \"Always Be My Baby\" and \"Get It On\" on the set-list came a performance for the male-audience of the show. While wearing another different white and black mini-skirt outfit and a black and white neck-lace, Carey joined a male jazz-band which took over a jazz-piece. The jazz-band took a noticeably larger part during this segment of the show. Including this segment, this song took up about eight to nine minutes of the concert. During the performance of \"Vision Of Love\" and \"When The Night Comes\", Trey Lorenz took on an out-of-character attitude. He started bouncing and moving in front-center and alongside Carey. The screen above-stage showed various colors and a constantly changing background-image. During \"Vision Of Love\" and \"When The Night Comes\", Trey Lorenz acted more-or-less like a go-go boy. For \"Never Forgive Me\" came yet another performance from Lorenz. He took on a much more manly and yet fun-loving attitude. Included in this segment were slideshows from previous albums.

Kong won the bout after slamming Josie back-first into the mat with her signature Awesome Bomb maneuver. A.J. Styles fought Kurt Angle in the sixth encounter of the show next. The match lasted 22 minutes and 44 seconds. Angle was accompanied by Tomko to the ring. The referee forced Tomko to head to the backstage area due to the referee believing he would interfere. Styles attempted to perform his signature Styles Clash maneuver on Angle, which Angle countered into his signature Ankle Lock submission hold. Styles escaped the hold, causing Angle to crash into the referee, knocking him out in the storyline. Karen Angle then ran down to the ringside area and attempted to hand Angle a steel chair. Once Angle grabbed the chair she refused to release, allowing Styles to grab Angle and perform the Styles Clash by slamming Angle face-first into the mat. Styles then followed with the pin attempt to win the contest. After the encounter, Angle and Tomko assaulted Styles. The main event was a King of the Mountain match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship with Kevin Nash as Special Guest Ringside Enforcer between then-champion Samoa Joe and the challengers Booker T, Christian Cage, Rhino, and Robert Roode. In a King of the Mountain match, the objective is to climb a ladder and hang the championship belt on a hook above the ring. In order to do so, a wrestler must first qualify by either pinning or making another wrestler submit in the match. A wrestler who is pinned or made to submit is this placed in a penalty box for two minutes. The match is fought under no disqualification rules. Booker T was the first to qualify by pinning Rhino after slamming him back-first into the mat with his signature Book End maneuver. Rhino was this placed in the penalty box.

Roode attempted to climb the ladder and pull the title from a hook above the ring, but Rhino knocked Roode from a ladder he climbed onto. As Rhino and Roode went at it, Roode pinned Rhino again with a roll-up pin. Rhino attempted a fourth pin on Roode. Roode escaped and held Rhino from climbing another ladder Roode climbed. As Rhino and Roode went at it, Roode pinned Rhino again for a total count of 3 pins. In doing so he also pinned a ringer Roode. This caused Roode to be placed in a penalty box for 2 minutes.

Mount Elbert was named by miners in honor of Samuel Hitt Elbert, the governor of the then-Territory of Colorado, because he brokered a treaty in September 1873 with the Ute tribe that opened up more than of reservation land to mining and railroad activity. The first recorded ascent of the peak was by H.W. Stuckle in 1874, who was surveying the mountain as part of the Hayden Survey. Originally measured as in height, Mount Elbert's elevation was later adjusted to following a re-evaluation of mapped elevations, which sparked protests. The actual change was made in 1988 as a result of the North American Vertical Datum of 1988; it seems the original measurement resulted from the Sea Level Datum of 1929. A matter of some contention arose after the Great Depression over the heights of Elbert and its neighbor Mount Massive, which differ in elevation by only . This led to an ongoing dispute that came to a head with the Mount Massive supporters building large piles of stones on the summit to boost its height, only to have the Mount Elbert proponents demolish them. The effort was ultimately unsuccessful and Mount Elbert has remained the highest peak in Colorado. The first motorized ascent of Elbert occurred in 1949, when a Jeep was driven to the summit, apparently to judge suitability for skiing development. The summit of Mount Elbert is an alpine environment, featuring plants such as Phacelia sericea (sky-pilot), Hymenoxys grandiflora (old-man-of-the-mountain), and Geum rossii (alpine avens).

The Rhodesian Security Forces launched several retaliatory strikes into Zambia and Mozambique over the following months, attacking both ZIPRA and its rival, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). The attack on ZIPRA in particular brought great controversy as many of those killed were refugees camping in and around guerrilla positions. In February 1979, ZIPRA shot down Air Rhodesia Flight 827, another civilian flight, in an almost identical incident. A dispute over the terms for the granting of full sovereignty to the self-governing colony of Rhodesia led the colonial government, headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith, to unilaterally declare independence from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965. The idea of \"no independence before majority rule\" had recently gained ground in Britain and elsewhere amid decolonisation, and Rhodesia's government was dominated by the country's white minority, so the unilateral declaration went unrecognised internationally. Britain and the United Nations imposed economic sanctions on Rhodesia. Two rival communist-backed black nationalist groups initiated military campaigns to overthrow the government and introduce majority rule: the Chinese-aligned Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), mostly comprising Shonas, created the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and adopted aspects of Maoist doctrine, while the Ndebele-dominated Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), aligned with Soviet-style Marxism\u2013Leninism and the Warsaw Pact, mobilised the Zimbabwe People's Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA). These guerrilla armies proceeded to wage what they called the \"Second Chimurenga\" against the Rhodesian government and security forces. The resulting conflict, the Rhodesian Bush War, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia. After the security forces mounted a successful counter-insurgency campaign during 1973 and 1974, developments overseas caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the insurgents' favour.", "gold_completion": "The leftist Carnation Revolution of April 1974 caused Portugal to withdraw its key economic support for Smith's administration, and led to Mozambique's independence the following year as a communist state openly allied with ZANU.

Meanwhile a U.S. diplomat attempted to broker a deal for Rhodesian independence; and during 1974 and 1975 a series of conferences took place between Rhodesia and Mozambique over a proposed Rhodesian-Mozambican railway.[43] The \"Samelsson\" plan for Rhodesian independence, initially supported by U.S. diplomat Ralph E.

He declared Rhodesia's intent to \"liquidate the internal workings of those organisations associated with terrorism\", and warned neighbouring countries to prepare for \"any defensive strikes we might undertake\" against guerrilla bases in their respective territories. He claimed that the war had escalated because Britain and the United States were supporting the Patriotic Front. William Irvine, the co-Minister of Transport, warned the guerrillas that Rhodesia \"w[ould] not let these innocents go unavenged\". Because ZAPU and ZIPRA were based in Zambia, many Rhodesians clamoured for a massive retaliatory strike against terrorist targets in that country, but the first external target hit by the security forces following the Viscount shootdown was the prominent cluster of ZANLA bases around Chimoio in Mozambique. The Rhodesian military had struck these bases extensively in November 1977 during Operation Dingo, destroying much of the ZANLA presence there, but the insurgents had since built a complex called \"New Chimoio\", slightly to the east; the new camps were distributed across a far larger area than the originals.", "gold_completion": "In a combined airborne-ground assault called Operation Snoopy, the Rhodesian Air Force, Rhodesian Light Infantry and Special Air Service wiped out much of New Chimoio on 20 September 1978.

In response, Rhodesia would inform Mozambique that it would be \"treat[ing] Mozambique on a one-for-one basis\" if it decided to go ahead and strike back against Rhodesian terrorist targets. The Rhodesians would first attempt to defend against guerrilla attacks through air strikes on terrorist bases and raids on infrastructure. They had been experimenting with coordinated and simultaneous air and ground operations as a way to intensify their ground efforts; in a two-day period from 11 September 1979 (the day after Rhodesia announced it would begin raiding terrorist bases on a one-for-one basis if Mozambique chose to respond to Rhodesian air raids with its own ground operations), their forces inflicted heavy casualties on two known terrorist bases, \"Mondo\" and \"Witness Tree\" (which"], "too_short": false, "z-score": [6.697263122599658, 4.427188724235731], "wm_pred": [1, 1], "gen_length": [300, 160], "num_green": [208, 108], "are_tokens_green": {"7133": ["During", 1, 1], "278": ["the", 0, 1], "13585": ["bomb", 1, 1], "538": ["ard", 1, 1], "358": ["ment", 0, 1], "310": ["of", 0, 5], "445": ["this", 1, 1], "9867": ["cluster", 0, 1], "22561": ["bases", 1, 4], "29892": [",", 0, 5], "263": ["a", 1, 11], "796": ["Z", 0, 3], "1117": ["amb", 0, 8], "713": ["ian", 1, 4], "13487": ["diplom", 1, 5], "271": ["at", 1, 4], "1058": ["who", 0, 1], "471": ["was", 0, 3], "22618": ["cousin", 1, 1], "423": ["ia", 1, 4], "29915": ["'", 0, 3], "29879": ["s", 1, 3], "7668": ["Minister", 1, 1], "19358": ["Foreign", 0, 1], "26049": ["Affairs", 1, 1], "10322": ["shot", 1, 1], "7123": ["dead", 1, 1], "1550": ["while", 1, 1], "19500": ["driving", 1, 1], "1549": ["through", 1, 2], "18129": ["Moz", 1, 5], "2185": ["ican", 1, 1], "5720": ["village", 1, 1], "29889": [".", 1, 5], "450": ["The", 1, 3], "19716": ["vehicle", 1, 1], "11122": ["contained", 1, 2], "2454": ["atic", 0, 2], "282": ["p", 1, 1], "3222": ["ouch", 0, 1], "607": ["which", 1, 2], "7333": ["personal", 1, 1], "8721": ["letters", 1, 1], "304": ["to", 0, 8], "367": ["be", 1, 2], "4502": ["passed", 1, 1], "373": ["on", 1, 7], "515": ["from", 1, 2], "3942": ["family", 0, 1], "884": ["also", 1, 1], "760": ["part", 1, 1], "7861": ["Rh", 1, 6], "2631": ["odes", 1, 6], "5874": ["government", 1, 1], "14734": ["attempts", 1, 1], "2545": ["bro", 1, 1], "3946": ["ker", 0, 1], "5376": ["deal", 1, 1], "723": ["would", 1, 5], "748": ["go", 1, 2], "934": ["file", 1, 1], "11595": ["formal", 1, 1], "10021": ["protest", 0, 1], "2750": ["against", 1, 3], "1387": ["ique", 0, 4], "512": ["In", 1, 1], "2933": ["response", 1, 1], "1871": ["inform", 0, 1], "393": ["that", 0, 1], "372": ["it", 1, 3], "376": ["\"", 1, 3], "2484": ["tre", 1, 1], "29961": ["[", 1, 1], "292": ["ing", 0, 2], "29962": ["]", 1, 1], "697": ["one", 1, 2], "29899": ["-", 1, 5], "1454": ["for", 0, 2], "650": ["one", 1, 2], "8405": ["basis", 0, 2], "29908": ["\"", 1, 3], "565": ["if", 1, 2], "8459": ["decided", 1, 1], "14432": ["ahead", 1, 1], "322": ["and", 1, 5], "21283": ["strike", 0, 1], "1250": ["back", 0, 1], "15115": ["terror", 1, 4], "391": ["ist", 0, 4], "22525": ["targets", 0, 1], "5834": ["ians", 1, 1], "937": ["first", 1, 1], "4218": ["attempt", 1, 1], "24663": ["defend", 1, 1], "1410": ["gu", 0, 1], "3127": ["err", 0, 1], "2911": ["illa", 1, 1], "16661": ["attacks", 1, 1], "4799": ["air", 1, 3], "19492": ["strik", 0, 1], "267": ["es", 1, 1], "1153": ["ra", 1, 3], "4841": ["ids", 0, 2], "22035": ["infrastr", 0, 1], "12425": ["ucture", 1, 1], "2688": ["They", 1, 1], "750": ["had", 0, 1], "1063": ["been", 1, 1], "7639": ["experiment", 1, 1], "411": ["with", 0, 2], "6615": ["coordin", 1, 1], "630": ["ated", 0, 1], "16991": ["simultane", 0, 1], "681": ["ous", 0, 1], "5962": ["ground", 1, 3], "6931": ["operations", 1, 2], "408": ["as", 1, 1], "982": ["way", 0, 1], "12838": ["intens", 1, 1], "1598": ["ify", 1, 1], "1009": ["their", 1, 2], "14231": ["efforts", 1, 1], "29936": [";", 1, 1], "297": ["in", 0, 1], "1023": ["two", 1, 2], "3250": ["day", 1, 1], "3785": ["period", 1, 1], "29871": ["", 1, 2], "29896": ["1", 1, 3], "3839": ["September", 1, 1], "29929": ["9", 1, 2], "29955": ["7", 0, 1], "313": ["(", 1, 2], "1552": ["the", 1, 1], "2462": ["day", 0, 1], "1156": ["after", 0, 1], "9326": ["announced", 0, 1], "3380": ["begin", 0, 1], "4821": ["iding", 1, 1], "12784": ["chose", 1, 1], "10049": ["respond", 0, 1], "967": ["its", 0, 1], "1914": ["own", 1, 1], "511": ["),", 0, 1], "8249": ["forces", 1, 1], "3041": ["inf", 1, 1], "506": ["lic", 1, 1], "9446": ["ted", 0, 1], "9416": ["heavy", 1, 1], "3209": ["cas", 1, 1], "950": ["ual", 0, 1], "2938": ["ties", 0, 1], "2998": ["known", 1, 1], "29924": ["M", 1, 1], "18592": ["ondo", 1, 1], "29956": ["W", 0, 1], "277": ["it", 0, 1], "2264": ["ness", 1, 1], "15472": ["Tree", 1, 1], "4716": ["which", 1, 1]}}

The RFU, at Hill's instigation, promptly demanded an apology from the Natives' captain of the day, Edward McCausland, who had led the team as Joe Warbrick was injured. The English authorities of the time believed that the decision of a referee was above question, and that protesting a decision as the New Zealanders had done was unsportsmanlike. The RFU threatened to bar any of their affiliated players \u2013 in other words, the entire rugby playing population of England \u2013 from facing the Natives if they did not apologise. McCausland swiftly sent an apology by telegram, but this was deemed inadequate; he therefore sent another, four days after the game: The London establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the New Zealanders' approach to the game; reports of rough and over-aggressive play by the Natives had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in Britain. In the north of England, criticism of the visitors' sportsmanship was rarer; the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents, which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south. Some of the Natives, including Joe Warbrick, accused the RFU and the English press of hypocrisy, claiming that they were quick to criticise the New Zealanders for rough play, yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players. The Natives remained in London following the England international. They defeated London Welsh on 18 February, before losing first to Cambridge, then Oxford University. From there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to Leigh. After a win over Runcorn, there was a defeat to Oldham, played on a ground Eyton said was so frozen it was dangerous. After reversing their previous loss to Halifax with a 6\u20130 win, the Natives suffered a loss to Barrow and District on 7 March.

{"time_completed": 1741880243, "prefix": "As they wrap up the case, Olivia, Peter, and Walter complete forms to finalize their position in the Fringe division. When Peter is out of earshot, Walter learns from Olivia that the FBI medical files on Peter's childhood are void of any details. Co-creators J. J. Abrams, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, and executive producer Jeff Pinkner wrote the episode. Paul A. Edwards served as the director, his first such credit for the series. In developing Fringe, the co-creators did not want to make the series too serialized, as this was a complaint often directed at Abrams' television series Alias. They wanted to find a balance between standalone stories and serialized content, and studied procedural dramas such as Law and Order and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation for inspiration. Kurztman explained, \"While we make sure that our episodes are self-contained \u2013 have a beginning, a middle, and an end \u2013 the character stories can be serialized. They don't have to resolve themselves over the course of one show.\" \"The Same Old Story\" was Fringes first regular episode, and some journalists viewed it as an example of how the series would be structured. The episode was based on actual recent research and involved much collaboration among the series' different departments. For the scene in which they remove the victim's eyeball, the special effects crew created a mold based on actress Elizabeth Stanley's head. Using plaster to make a prosthetic, they \"drilled out the eyeball and sculpt[ed] it open and [went] through a series of molds.\" Stanley stated that \"it's really cool to see the head because it really does look just like me, even though it's very gruesome because the eyeball's popping out.\" The prop department rigged a weapon which they called a \"photon gun\"; according to prop master Peter Gelfman, this gun was based on real devices employed in airport security that look through people's clothing for concealed weapons.", "gold_completion": "VFX Supervisor Christopher Scollard explained that for the eye's last vision, they used \"a lot of actual photographic reference on the set and on the location,\" which they then used to \"take that imagery and composite it into the various computer monitors and displays in the lab.\" \"The Same Old Story\" featured guest appearances by actors Derek Cecil as Christopher Penrose and Mark Blum as his father, Dr. Claus Penrose.", "gen_completion": ["The production team knew before they started on \"The Same Old Story\" that they would \"give Peter\" a headshot gun. Aaron Johnson portrayed Peter and he and Stanley talked about how \"crazy\" and \"whack\" he looks; Stanley also stated \"as soon as [the prop team] found out they were making it they started making it. It wasn't on our shoot. They had it built before we even shot this episode. They were amazing. It took about three hours to build it and they had us a headshot gun before we started shooting. I got about a month-long headshot.\" \"There is a lot of CG [graphics] on the show. A majority of it [is] for effects and stunts. When we shot this episode I never saw the eyeball. I only saw it once and I saw it from a mile away. It was something else. It really is impressive.\"[21] Walter explains some serialized content. The third episode \"Crossing Over\" aired a week later and attracted a larger audience. This episode also focused on Walter and his reconnection to his late wife. However, 1994 Super Bowl champion and NFL MVP Kurt Warner portrayed \"Major\" Charles Kent on \"Crossing Over\".

MI6 agent James Bond infiltrates a North Korean military base where Colonel Tan-Sun Moon is illegally trading weapons for African conflict diamonds. After Moon's right-hand man Zao is contacted by an unknown source who reveals Bond's true identity, Moon attempts to kill Bond and a hovercraft chase ensues, ending with Moon's apparent death. Bond survives but is captured by North Korean soldiers and imprisoned by the Colonel's father, General Moon. After fourteen months of captivity and torture at the hands of the Korean People's Army, Bond is traded for Zao in a prisoner exchange. He is sedated and taken to meet M, who informs him that his status as a 00 Agent has been suspended under suspicion of having leaked information under duress to the North Koreans. Bond is convinced that he has been set up by a double agent in the British government. After escaping MI6 custody, he discovers that he is in Hong Kong, where he learns from Chang, a Chinese agent and old colleague, that Zao is in Cuba. In Havana, Bond meets NSA agent Giacinta \"Jinx\" Johnson. Bond follows her to a gene therapy clinic, where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring. Bond locates Zao inside the clinic and attempts to kill him, but Zao escapes, leaving behind a pendant which leads Bond to a cache of diamonds, identified as conflict diamonds, but bearing the crest of the company owned by British billionaire businessman Gustav Graves. Bond learns that Graves only appeared a year prior, apparently discovering a vein of diamonds in Iceland leading to his current wealth, celebrity, and philanthropy from its assets.

The English authorities of the time believed that the decision of a referee was above question, and that protesting a decision as the New Zealanders had done was unsportsmanlike. The RFU threatened to bar any of their affiliated players \u2013 in other words, the entire rugby playing population of England \u2013 from facing the Natives if they did not apologise. McCausland swiftly sent an apology by telegram, but this was deemed inadequate; he therefore sent another, four days after the game: The London establishment that governed the game were disturbed by the New Zealanders' approach to the game; reports of rough and over-aggressive play by the Natives had steadily increased in frequency since their arrival in Britain. In the north of England, criticism of the visitors' sportsmanship was rarer; the tourists were accepted as playing the game in the same spirit as their local opponents, which in the north was a more working class sport than in the south. Some of the Natives, including Joe Warbrick, accused the RFU and the English press of hypocrisy, claiming that they were quick to criticise the New Zealanders for rough play, yet tolerant of similar behaviour from their own players. The Natives remained in London following the England international. They defeated London Welsh on 18 February, before losing first to Cambridge, then Oxford University. From there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to Leigh. After a win over Runcorn, there was a defeat to Oldham, played on a ground Eyton said was so frozen it was dangerous. After reversing their previous loss to Halifax with a 6\u20130 win, the Natives suffered a loss to Barrow and District on 7 March. The New Zealanders then had a run of seven straight wins before a 1\u20131 draw with Hull. Widnes were then defeated for the second time in two weeks in the tourists' last match in northern England.

The authorities and press in London continued to view the team negatively, and the Natives boarded ship without a formal farewell. This perceived affront from the RFU provoked some criticism from the press outside London, as well as from the team manager Scott, who felt that with the team's official apology after the England match, the controversy should have put to rest.

The tourists attracted large and enthusiastic crowds wherever they went and drew from all walks of life. An estimated 25,000 people saw them in the Auckland Domain on 29 March. The New Zealand Rugby Union covered their expenses and some of their profit. The All Blacks are often credited as being the first rugby tour to the Southern Hemisphere. However, a tour led by John \"Jack\" Bickerton had sailed from Sydney on 11 January 1912. This tour was initially sponsored by the Australian Rugby Union but as it wandered through various islands and territories en route they were financially supported and encouraged. The All Blacks tour in 1922-23 was one of the first attempts to sponsor a tour financially. 2022 All blacks will be doing exactly what they did in 1912, a 12 man team led and coached by a couple of professional players will be a learning experience for all involved and will be held together as a team not a conglomeration of a number of clubs. Will it be a success we will never know but we can say as a nation we are really looking forward to this tour.

{"time_completed": 1741881790, "prefix": "Later in the Early Classic a new superstructure was added, with its own masks and decorated panels. During the Hiatus a third stage was built over the earlier constructions, the stairway was demolished and another royal burial, of an unidentified ruler, was set into the structure (Burial 23). While the new pyramid was being built another high ranking tomb (Burial 24) was inserted into the rubble core of the building. The pyramid was then completed, standing tall. The final version of Temple 33 was completely dismantled by archaeologists in 1965 in order to arrive at the earlier stages of construction.Structure 34 is a pyramid in the North Acropolis that was built by Siyaj Chan K'awiil II over the tomb of his father, Yax Nuun Ayiin I. The pyramid was topped by a three chambered shrine, the rooms situated one behind the other.Structure 5D-43 is an unusual radial temple in the East Plaza, built over a pre-existing twin pyramid complex. It is built into the end of the East Plaza Ballcourt and possessed four entry doorways and three stairways, the fourth (south) side was too close to the Central Acropolis for a stairway on that side. The building has a talud-tablero platform profile, modified from the original style found at Teotihuacan. In fact, it has been suggested that the style of the building has closer affinities with El Tajin and Xochicalco than with Teotihuacan itself. The vertical tablero panels are set between sloping talud panels and are decorated with paired disc symbols. Large flower symbols are set into the sloping talud panels, related to the Venus and star symbols used at Teotihuacan. The roof of the structure was decorated with friezes although only fragments now remain, showing a monstrous face, perhaps that of a jaguar, with another head emerging from the mouth. The second head possesses a bifurcated tongue but is probably not that of a snake.", "gold_completion": "The temple, and its associated ballcourt, probably date to the reign of Nuun Ujol Chaak or that of his son Jasaw Chan K'awiil I, in the later part of the 7th century.Structure 5C-49 possesses a clear Teotihuacan-linked architectural style; it has balustrades, an architectural feature that is very rare in the Maya region, and a talud-tablero fa\u00e7ade; it dates to the 4th century AD.", "gen_completion": ["The radial temple was certainly a pyramid, but during later times it received a rectangular shape.

An uptempo dance song, \"Sorry\" was one of the first tracks developed for the album. One remix on the CD maxi single was done by the Pet Shop Boys, featuring added lyrics by the band. The song features a dance groove tempo, and talks about personal empowerment and self-sufficiency. \"Sorry\" received positive reviews from contemporary critics, who declared the track the strongest song on Confessions on a Dance Floor.

In a closing sequence, Madonna led a march and speech at a rally and protest. The clip was directed by Jenniferridge. It received generally mixed reviews.

{"time_completed": 1741883207, "prefix": "\"If there were any parties going on, they'd be tipped off as to where they were.\" Radcliffe first expressed a desire to act at age five, and, aged ten, he made his acting debut in BBC One's televised two-part adaptation of the Charles Dickens novel David Copperfield (1999), portraying the title character as a young boy. Radcliffe made his film debut in The Tailor of Panama (2001), an American film based on John le Carr\u00e9's 1996 spy novel, and a moderate commercial success. In 2000, producer David Heyman asked Radcliffe to audition for the role of Harry Potter for the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the best-selling book by British author J. K. Rowling. Rowling had been searching for an unknown British actor to personify the character, and the film's director Chris Columbus recalled thinking, \"This is what I want. This is Harry Potter\" after he saw a video of the young actor in David Copperfield. Eight months later, following several auditions, Radcliffe was selected to play the part. Rowling endorsed the selection, saying: \"I don't think Chris Columbus could have found a better Harry.\" Radcliffe's parents originally turned down the offer, as they had been told that it would involve six films shot in Los Angeles. Warner Bros. instead offered Radcliffe a two-film contract with shooting in the UK; Radcliffe was unsure at the time if he would act in more than two Harry Potter films. The release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone took place in 2001. Radcliffe received a seven-figure salary for the lead role, but asserted that the fee was \"not that important\" to him; his parents chose to invest the money for him. The film was highly popular and was met with positive reviews, and critics took notice of Radcliffe: \"Radcliffe is the embodiment of every reader's imagination. It is wonderful to see a young hero who is so scholarly looking and filled with curiosity and who connects with very real emotions, from solemn intelligence and the delight of discovery to deep family longing,\" wrote Bob Graham of the San Francisco Chronicle.", "gold_completion": "A year later, Radcliffe starred in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the second instalment of the series. Reviewers were positive about the lead actors' performances but had polarising opinions on the film overall. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004) was the third film in the series. Radcliffe's performance was criticised by The New York Times film critic A. O. Scott, who felt that co-star Emma Watson had to carry him with her performance.", "gen_completion": ["The release of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets followed later in 2002. Radcliffe noted that while he would have preferred being on location shooting and acting as opposed to working in a studio, he preferred working in the UK. In 2002, Radcliffe began his formal education at Magdalene College, a constituent college of the University of Cambridge. While he continued his acting and his education, he noted how his fame continued to affect his personal life. Radcliffe appeared on The Jerry Seinfeld Show (2002) and Access Granted (2002). However, he noted how working on Harry Potter and The Chamber of Secrets (2002) helped him; he stated: \"A year and a half ago I would not have been ready. I wouldn't have been ready for it emotionally. I would have been too scared to be a true hero. The camera would have been [making] too much of a difference for [me].\" During a year and a half hiatus from the films, Radcliffe worked on The Tailor of Panama and appeared on stage in a production of Peter and Alice (2003) at The Menier Chocolate Factory.

The route bends to the north and continues along the Delaware River for several miles, crossing into Frenchtown, where the route becomes Trenton Road. Upon entering Frenchtown, an end shield for northbound Route 29 is posted to mark the end of state maintenance, which officially ends at the Washington Street intersection, where maintenance is transferred to the county.

The Natives remained in London following the England international. They defeated London Welsh on 18 February, before losing first to Cambridge, then Oxford University. From there they travelled north and won two matches before losing to Leigh. After a win over Runcorn, there was a defeat to Oldham, played on a ground Eyton said was so frozen it was dangerous. After reversing their previous loss to Halifax with a 6\u20130 win, the Natives suffered a loss to Barrow and District on 7 March. The New Zealanders then had a run of seven straight wins before a 1\u20131 draw with Hull. Widnes were then defeated for the second time in two weeks in the tourists' last match in northern England. The team struggled to find an opponent for their final match in Britain. They eventually played Southern Counties, and beat them 3\u20131. This was their 74th match in the British Isles and their 49th victory. The authorities and press in London continued to view the team negatively, and the Natives boarded ship without a formal farewell. This perceived affront from the RFU provoked some criticism from the press outside London, as well as from the team manager Scott, who felt that with the team's official apology after the England match, the controversy should have put to rest. The majority of the Natives left Plymouth on 29 March (Eyton and Pie Wynyard followed a week later). They arrived in Melbourne in May, where the team played mostly Victorian Rules football, hoping to make more money that way. Although the side had employed Jack Lawlor to coach them in Victorian Rules during their tour of the British Isles, the heavy schedule and high injury count had left little time and energy for such training. As a result, the Victorian Rules matches were a failure; the players' unfamiliarity with the rules, combined with the fact that most of the Natives were rugby forwards (and therefore less suited to the more open Victorian Rules), ensured that they failed to perform well on the field and struggled to attract large crowds.", "gold_completion": "The side played nine Victorian Rules matches in total, including one in New South Wales, but won only three of them, all against relatively weak opposition.

{"time_completed": 1741885858, "prefix": "Some of Churchill's Native American critics, such as Vernon Bellecourt (White Earth Ojibwe) and Suzan Shown Harjo (Southern Cheyenne-Muscogee Creek), argue that his assertion of Native American ancestry without the ability to prove it might constitute misrepresentation and grounds for termination. The University has said that it does not hire on the basis of ethnicity. The University of Colorado's Research Misconduct Committee conducted a preliminary investigation into whether Churchill misrepresented his ethnicity to \"add credibility and public acceptance to his scholarship\". The committee concluded that the allegation was not \"appropriate for further investigation under the definition of research misconduct\". In a 2005 interview in The Rocky Mountain News, Churchill said, \"I have never been confirmed as having one-quarter blood, and never said I was. And even if [the critics] are absolutely right, what does that have to do with this issue? I have never claimed to be goddamned Sitting Bull.\" The longtime indigenous activist Russell Means said in February of that year, \"So I want, from this day forward, every media person nationally, internationally and locally to know that we have ascertained that Ward Churchill is a full-blooded Indian leader.\" Churchill has responded to requests for verification of his asserted Indian heritage in various ways, including attacking the blood quantum upon which some Native American tribes establish their membership requirements. Churchill argues that the United States instituted blood quantum laws based upon rules of descendancy in order to further goals of personal enrichment and political expediency. For decades in his writings, Churchill has argued that blood quantum laws have an inherent genocidal purpose. He says, Set the blood quantum at one-quarter, hold to it as a rigid definition of Indians, let intermarriage proceed as it [has] and eventually Indians will be defined out of existence. Churchill's assertions have been raised as one of the several research-misconduct allegations that were brought against him in 2005 (see below). He has been accused of using his interpretation of the Dawes Act to attack tribal governments that would not recognize him as a member.", "gold_completion": "Churchill has written on American Indian history and culture, and what he describes as the genocide inflicted on the indigenous people of the Americas by European-American settlers and the ongoing repression of native peoples.

I am a human being. I am a human being who lives on this land and whom this land nourishes. I am not just a visitor. I am a co-owner and co-operator and co-creator.\" In the fall 2004 semester, he received three Native American (blood-quantum) enrollments from two different enrollment firms.

{"time_completed": 1741886748, "prefix": "Upsilon Andromedae b (\u03c5 Andromedae b, abbreviated Upsilon And b, \u03c5 And b), formally named Saffar , is an extrasolar planet approximately 44 light-years away from the Sun in the constellation of Andromeda. The planet orbits the solar analog star, Upsilon Andromedae A, approximately every five days. Discovered in June 1996 by Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler, it was one of the first hot Jupiters to be discovered. It is also one of the first non-resolved planets to be detected directly. Upsilon Andromedae b is the innermost known planet in its planetary system. In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Saffar for this planet. The winning name was submitted by the Vega Astronomy Club of Morocco and honours the 11th Century astronomer Ibn al-Saffar of Muslim Spain. Upsilon Andromedae b was detected by the variations in its star's radial velocity caused by the planet's gravity. The variations were detected by making sensitive measurements of the Doppler shift of Upsilon Andromedae's spectrum. The planet's existence was announced in January 1997, together with 55 Cancri b and the planet orbiting Tau Bo\u00f6tis. Like 51 Pegasi b, the first extrasolar planet discovered around a normal star, Upsilon Andromedae b orbits very close to its star, closer than Mercury does to our Sun. The planet takes 4.617 days to complete an orbit, with a semimajor axis of 0.0595 AU.", "gold_completion": "A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect Upsilon Andromedae b is that only a lower limit on the mass can be found. The true mass may be much greater depending on the inclination of the orbit. A mass of and an inclination of 24\u00b0 were later found using high-resolution spectroscopy. Given the planet's high mass, it is likely that Upsilon Andromedae b is a gas giant with no solid surface.", "gen_completion": ["At this distance, Upsilon Andromedae b is more massive (approximately 2.3 times more massive) than Jupiter. Upsilon Andromedae b is also one of the first exoplanets for which physical parameters (mass and radius) were estimated from direct detection observations. In 1999, Marcy and Butler estimated Upsilon Andromedae b's radius and mass: The planet's radius is 2.3 times larger than Jupiter's (1.23 \u00d7 1011 km, 1.23 \u00d7 1012 km; this compares to 1.32 \u00d7 1011 km for Jupiter, and 1.1 \u00d7 1012 km for Uranus.

The Washington Post said the track is \"a bit oblique lyrically, but the implications are clear in Bono's resolute delivery, Dave (the Edge) Evan's quavering guitar, Adam Clayton's cathedral bass and Larry Mullen's rolling thunder drums\". NME lauded the song as the opening track by saying the album \"starts by spitting furiously\". The publication praised Bono's impassioned singing and The Edge's guitar playing, which transformed the instrument into \"something more than an endlessly abused piece of wood\". The review commented that the \"last ten seconds are breathtakingly beautiful\". The Rocket wrote that the song builds a \"wall of sound\" that Bono's vocals cut through with a \"wail of desperation, as the lyrics agonize the need for personal spirituality\". The reviewer compared the opening riff to Simple Minds' \"Ghostdancing\". Reviewing The Joshua Tree, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic called the song an \"epic opener\".

It adds features including the ability to use moves from Sonic 2 and Sonic Mania, a challenge mode, a time attack for the first stage, and features from the 3DS rereleases of the game and its sequel. U.S. Gold acquired the rights to make a version of Sonic the Hedgehog for the Amiga, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and Atari ST personal computers, but these went unreleased. Several screenshots exist, some of which resemble the 8-bit version. An enhanced port for the Sega CD was also planned, but was scrapped in favor of Sonic CD. Sonic the Hedgehog was praised by critics, with an 86% rating at the review aggregator GameRankings. It was considered Sega's answer to Nintendo's widely popular Mario series, as it was a platformer featuring the company's mascot.

Frank Ladoire of believed Sonic the Hedgehog was part of a new generation of games that demonstrate that the Genesis is capable of \"beautiful things\" in the technical department. Reviewers praised the colorful, detailed graphics. Rand called its color scheme \"lively, but never garish\", praising the interaction of color with detail in the sprites, backgrounds, and animations and describing its graphics as the best available for the Genesis. Reviewer Boogie Man of GamePro called the intricate backgrounds \"eye-popping\" and \"gorgeous\", which was echoed by Mean Machines. The Lessers (Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk) of Dragon claimed the graphics made Sonic a possible contender for the best game of 1991 and GameZone called the animation \"some of the smoothest and fastest ... ever seen\". Julian Boardman of Raze praised the \"colourful and highly detailed\" backdrops and \"fabulous\" sprites.", "gold_completion": "The music and sound effects were also well received; Dragon called them \"great\", and GameZone \"amazing\".

Critics cited the fast gameplay, unprecedented in platformers. The difficulty was disputed, described as \"impossible\" by Rand and \"average\" by EGM.", "gen_completion": ["Martin Smith of MegaTech similarly described their vibrancy and enthusiastically enjoyed how \"Sega really knows how to do pixel-art right\" as he enjoyed playing as Sonic.

Mean Machine applauded the graphic display and moving colors. Critics described the music as a \"treat\" and \"lively\" while arguing it was \"catchy\" and described the sound effects as \"excellent\" and \"cute\" and \"very annoying\".

In November 1950, Headlam was appointed to take over command of No. 90 (Composite) Wing from Group Captain Paddy Heffernan. Headquartered at RAF Changi, Singapore, No. 90 Wing controlled RAAF units operating during the Malayan Emergency: No. 1 (Bomber) Squadron, flying Avro Lincolns, and No. 38 (Transport) Squadron, flying Douglas C-47 Dakotas. The Lincolns conducted area bombing missions over communist-held territory, as well as strikes against pinpoint targets. The Dakotas were tasked with courier flights, VIP transport and medical evacuations across South East Asia, and in Malaya with airlifting troops and cargo, dropping supplies to friendly forces and despatching propaganda leaflets. Headlam was slightly injured on 20 December, when a No. 38 Squadron Dakota he was co-piloting on a supply drop crash-landed at Kampong Aur in Pahang, following engine failure. In August 1951 he was named commander of RAF Tengah, Singapore, in addition to his post as commanding officer of No. 90 Wing. Headlam handed over command of No. 90 Wing in December 1951. On 19 February 1952, Headlam became senior air staff officer (SASO) at Eastern Area Command in Penrith, New South Wales. During his term as SASO, the RAAF began re-equipping with English Electric Canberra jet bombers and CAC Sabre jet fighters. The Air Force also underwent a major organisational change, as it transitioned from a geographically based command-and-control system to one based on function, resulting in the establishment of Home (operational), Training, and Maintenance Commands. Eastern Area Command, considered a de facto operational headquarters owing to the preponderance of combat units under its control, was reorganised as Home Command in October 1953.

Art exhibitions were originally held in Lamar Hotel in downtown Meridian, but after a name change to Meridian Art Association in 1949, exhibitions were held at various locations around the city. After the Carnegie library at 25th Ave and 7th St was closed, the Art Association remodelled the building into the Meridian Museum of Art to serve as a permanent home for exhibits. The museum was opened in 1970 and has since featured rotating exhibitions as well as many educational programs for both students and adults. Over thirty exhibitions are held annually, ranging from traditional decorative arts to ethnographic and tribal materials, photography, crafts, and many other works of art.

Their intention was to purchase guns which were difficult to trace. Caldwell said it was easy to obtain guns in New Mexico: \"we found it was pretty easy to buy guns. All you had to do was show some identification and it was easy to get.\" Caldwell said she and Stork went to a university library to find the identity \"of someone dying very young\", next went \"to public records and asked for a copy of a birth certificate\" and described how \"we got a rent receipt book and just made up a rent receipt\". \"And then we were able to go to several different gun shops in Albuquerque with those two bits of identification and buy five different guns and bullets,\" said Caldwell. They were able to obtain one Colt .38-caliber revolver, and four Ruger .357-caliber Security-Six Magnum revolvers. The conspirators smuggled the guns into Oregon by packing them in luggage and putting the luggage on a Greyhound Lines bus.

Plans for a limited-access route along the Route 29 corridor go back to 1932, when a parkway was proposed along the Delaware River between Trenton and Lambertville; this proposal never materialized. Plans for a freeway were resurrected in the early 1950s to construct a road, the John Fitch Parkway, that was to run from Hamilton Township to Interstate 95 (now Interstate 295) in Ewing Township. This road was built between 1954 and 1957 from South Warren Street in Trenton to present-day I-295 in Ewing Township. Construction of this portion of the John Fitch Parkway took up much of Trenton\u2019s available waterfront along the Delaware River. The former alignment of Route 29 in the northern part of Trenton and in Ewing Township became Route 175. Between 1990 and 1995, the Route 29 freeway was built between the I-195/I-295 interchange and Route 129 in Hamilton Township. A two-lane street, Lamberton Road, connected the two freeway sections. Plans were then made to fill the gap between the two freeway sections in Trenton. Construction began in 1997 on the Route 29 freeway between Route 129 and the Morrisville\u2013Trenton Railroad Bridge. The road was to include two traffic lights at Cass Street and South Warren Street and a tunnel which was to be built as a covered roadway on the bank of the Delaware River. The tunnel was originally scheduled to be complete by 2001 but was delayed after the Army Corps of Engineers discovered many environmental violations that occurred with construction of the tunnel. The roof was put in place in October 2001 and the tunnel officially opened to traffic on March 2, 2002. A restriction to trucks over 13 tons was put in place and made permanent in November 2002. By the 2000s, the state gave the part of Route 29 (South Main Street) between Route 165 and Route 179 in Lambertville to the city, and Route 29 was rerouted to use all of Route 165 and one block of Route 179.

The team read Famitsu to stay informed of what their rivals were doing so they could avoid their mistakes. Sega director Fujio Minegishi had connections to the music industry, and suggested his friend Y\u016bz\u014d Kayama write the Sonic score. However, Sonic Team did not think Kayama's music would fit, and so commissioned Masato Nakamura, bassist and songwriter of the J-pop band Dreams Come True. Nakamura said he was surprised when asked to create the soundtrack, as he had just started with Dreams Come True, but accepted as he was inspired by the team's desire to outperform Nintendo. Nakamura said the hardest part of creating the soundtrack was the number of sounds that could play concurrently: he was limited to four, and said that his lack of knowledge of music on computers made it \"impossible\". He wrote the soundtrack concurrently with the Dreams Come True album Million Kisses. On October 19, 2011, over 20 years after the release, a three-disc compilation of music from Sonic the Hedgehog and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was released in Japan. The first disc features original tracks from both games, the second contains Nakamura's demo recordings before they were programmed into the Genesis, and the third has songs by Dreams Come True and their associated Akon remixes. Game-package illustrator Akira Watanabe said that his goal was to make the characters \"colorful\", using clear lines and gradation to \"finish them neatly\". According to Watanabe, the developers asked him to create a package design \"similar to pop art ... without being particular to conventional packages\" \u2013 something \"original\" and \"stylish\". The game was not revealed until the January 1991 International Consumer Electronics Show because Sega wanted to wait until the right time and because they saw an opportunity to \"steal the show\".

Prince Sangqudar was the commander-in-chief of the invasion force; his deputies were Vice Governor Taipn, and commander Yagan Tegin. The Mongol armies marched to the border in two columns. One column advanced along the Taping River using over 200 boats; the other proceeded by land and joined the first column at the Burmese fort at Ngasaunggyan. The Burmese chronicles report an overwhelming number of Mongol forces laying siege to the fort although their numbers are greatly exaggerated. (The chronicles say that the Burmese army numbered 400,000 men while the Mongol army numbered 20 million men and 6 million horses.) The Burmese withstood the siege for over two months but the fort fell on 3 December 1283. The defeat at Ngasaunggyan broke the back of Burmese defenses. The Burmese army lost several thousand men as well as senior commanders. Kaungsin, the next fort in line, fell just six days later on 9 December 1283. The Mongol sources say that the Burmese lost 10,000 men at Kaungsin. The Mongol armies pushed farther south into the Irrawaddy valley. They took the ancient Burmese capital of Tagaung, about 380 km north of Pagan on 5 February 1284. There, the invaders paused their advance. They found the heat of the searing Irrawaddy valley excessive, and evacuated Tagaung, allowing the Burmese to return to Tagaung on 10 May 1284. But the Mongol army renewed their offensive in the following dry season. They retook Tagaung, and defeated another Burmese stand south of Tagaung, probably near Hanlin, on 26 January 1285, opening the way to Pagan, about 270 km south. After the defeat, the king panicked, and fled to Lower Burma. The evacuation proved premature. The Mongol forces did not advance on Pagan as it was not part of their invasion plan. The country fell into chaos.", "gold_completion": "In Lower Burma, the king found himself isolated, let alone plan a counterattack.

Without the full support of his sons, the presence of the king and his small army impressed no one. The governor of Pegu revolted that same year. The king managed to send two small expeditions to Pegu but they both failed.", "gen_completion": ["In 1293 Prince Uzana took over Pagan and crowned himself king. In 1292, Uzana took over Upper Burma and crowned himself king. The Northwestern and North-Central zones from 1230s to 1313 were mostly independent from one another. The fall of Upper Burma on 11 June 1313 saw all of Upper Burma and Lower Burma fall under a common ruler for the first time. Burma first came under Mongol Yuan Dynasty ruler direction on 11 June 1313 when Ava fell. The Burmese continued their fight for 33 years before they were totally defeated on 10 July 1317. The invasion and conquest cost about 20 million Mongols lives, and about 1.5 million Burmese lives. The Mongols did not get all the minerals and precious stones they wanted.

{"time_completed": 1741943879, "prefix": "The Hunyani was on the second and final leg of its regular scheduled journey between Victoria Falls and Salisbury, stopping over in the resort town of Kariba. Despite the occasional rocket and mortar attacks launched on Kariba by ZIPRA guerrillas on the northern side of the Zambezi (in Zambia), the resort had endured as one of Rhodesia's choice tourist destinations. The flight on 3 September 1978, Sunday afternoon, from Kariba to Salisbury carried four crew members and 52 passengers, most of whom were holidaymakers from Salisbury, returning home after a weekend at the lake. The flight took off from Kariba Airport on schedule soon after 17:00 Central Africa Time. Flight 825 was piloted by 36-year-old Captain John Hood, a native of Bulawayo who had gained his commercial pilot licence in 1966. He had flown Viscounts for Air Rhodesia since 1968, and had also served in the Rhodesian Air Force on a voluntary basis. His first officer, Garth Beaumont, was 31 years old, and had lived in Rhodesia for most of his life, having immigrated as a child from South Africa. The two air stewardesses were Dulcie Esterhuizen, 21 years old and from Bulawayo, and 23-year-old Louise Pearson, from Salisbury. A group of ZIPRA guerrillas, armed with a Strela-2 launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight 825's flightpath, and fired on the Hunyani about five minutes after it took off, while the aircraft was still in the climb phase of its flight. The heat-seeking missile hit the plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire that could not be put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly. At 17:10 Captain Hood sent a distress call to air traffic control, informing them that he had lost the two starboard engines and was going to crash. \"We're going in,\" he radioed.", "gold_completion": "Telling his passengers to brace for an emergency landing, he aimed for an open field of cotton in the Whamira Hills, in the bush to the west of Karoi, intending to belly land the craft. The landing was relatively stable until the Hunyani hit a ditch, cartwheeled and exploded. The remaining fuel tanks ruptured and caught fire, setting the wrecked cabin ablaze. Of the 56 people on board, 38, including Hood and Beaumont, died in the crash.", "gen_completion": ["A rapid series of air traffic control radio messages followed. \"Nothing doing,\" one controller told him. \"Fallo,\" he replied. \"Fallo,\" the response came. As Flight 825 careened towards the ground, Esterhuizen and Pearson started opening the cabin doors and yelled \"Get out!\" The two women joined Captain Hood and his first officer in the cockpit. Hood and Beaumont began frantically yanking and pushing levers and switches. The fire enveloped the cockpit. The two women were burned to death in less than five minutes. The three male aircrew members barely escaped. Moments later they tumbled out of the Hunyani's over-opened cockpit door and slid across the ground. They picked themselves up and headed towards a nearby coppice as if in a state of shock. They climbed a stone wall and lay down. They were too badly injured to stand. They were later found by villagers and taken to a nearby compound. They were still being treated when a plane from Air Rhodesia, Flight 119, landed and picked them up. Their leg and head injuries were not as serious as originally feared.

{"time_completed": 1741944235, "prefix": "The sound test was scrapped for time reasons and Naka used the freed up memory to add the \"Se-ga!\" chant used in TV commercials as a startup sound. Naka's relationship with Sega was tenuous during this time, and he received little credit for his work. He left the company shortly after the game's release, although Sega of America hired him later. Before leaving, however, he defied Sega's prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background, identifiable only by looking at the code. Naka stated that level design was a major challenge: he created maps much wider than normal and tried to ensure players would not get lost. It took him around eight months to develop Green Hill Zone as he kept restarting from scratch. He stated that he found the process \"very interesting\". Naka also stated that the team was trying to create smooth maps, and that implementing looping structures was a challenge because Sonic would break through them instead of running around them. The backgrounds were also a challenge, as the game's speed created the impression of going backwards. The zones were based on designs by Naka and Ohshima, with the goal of creating the world's fastest action game. According to Ohshima, Robotnik was based on Humpty Dumpty. Yasuhara wanted the game to appeal to both Japanese and American players, which was why Green Hill Zone was redesigned many times. Sonic Team wanted the level to portray the character correctly. Its checkered ground was inspired by 3D image rendering from computers, an idea Naka obtained from Sega developer Yu Suzuki, who used this technique with Space Harrier. The team read Famitsu to stay informed of what their rivals were doing so they could avoid their mistakes. Sega director Fujio Minegishi had connections to the music industry, and suggested his friend Y\u016bz\u014d Kayama write the Sonic score. However, Sonic Team did not think Kayama's music would fit, and so commissioned Masato Nakamura, bassist and songwriter of the J-pop band Dreams Come True.", "gold_completion": "Nakamura said he was surprised when asked to create the soundtrack, as he had just started with Dreams Come True, but accepted as he was inspired by the team's desire to outperform Nintendo. Nakamura said the hardest part of creating the soundtrack was the number of sounds that could play concurrently: he was limited to four, and said that his lack of knowledge of music on computers made it \"impossible\". He wrote the soundtrack concurrently with the Dreams Come True album Million Kisses.", "gen_completion": ["Nakamura started out as a musician for all levels, but as he began working on compositions he switched completely. Nakamura found Yoshitaka Akiyama's music too mellow and Japanese for the American market. As a result, he created music that contained orchestral elements and American synthesizers. It took him 11 hours to compose the boss music. He also composed some of the levels' music. While working on the soundtrack for Green Hills Zone, Nakamura played rough versions for his friends and they all told him he was creating music better than most professionals. They said he would be famous if he got more opportunities. However Nakamura would not give it another thought until he was ready. Nakamura's soundtrack consisted of mainly strong American influences. The American music he created a smooth sound. It inspired him to create something more Japanese. He also created a balanced sound that combined Japanese and American influences.

Emboldened by his success, T\u014dg\u014d resumed long-range bombardment missions, prompting the Russians to lay more minefields, which sank two Japanese battleships the following month. During the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August, Asahi, now commanded by Captain Tsunaakira Nomoto, was second in line of the column of Japanese battleships, behind Mikasa, and was one of the primary targets of the Russian ships. She was only hit by a single 12-inch shell that wounded two crewmen. Both guns in her aft 12-inch gun turret, however, were disabled by shells that detonated prematurely in their barrels. In turn she concentrated most of her fire upon the battleships and although both ships were only lightly damaged by the Japanese shells, which generally failed to penetrate any armour and detonated on impact. The ship made the critical hits of the battle, however, when two of her 12-inch shells struck the bridge of Tsesarevich, killing the Russian squadron commander, Vice Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft, two of his staff officers and the ship's quartermaster. The ship's wheel was jammed to port by wreckage and then slowed to a halt which threw the rest of the Russian ships into total confusion. The second-in-command, Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky, eventually gained control of the remainder of the squadron and headed back to Port Arthur. Slightly more than two months later, on 26 October, Asahi struck a mine off Port Arthur while on blockade duty. Severely damaged, she was under repair at Sasebo Naval Arsenal from November 1904 to April 1905. Russian naval forces in the Far East had been destroyed or neutralized by this time and the Russians were forced to transfer ships from the Baltic Fleet that did not arrive until May.

Asahi sustained two more severe damaged gun barrels but as Tsesarevich moved nearer Tsushima-Yoko-12. One 12-inch shell from Asahi struck Tsesarevich on the aft superstructure killing a Russian lieutenant and wounding two others. Tsesarevich also achieved a salvo on Asahi but neither ship was seriously damaged. After two more attacks on Tsesarevich Asahi moved closer and fire was opened on their stern. It later appeared that the battleships exchanged over thirty shells. At 11:30 Asahi opened fire on a Russian cruiser which received five 12-inch shells from Asahi and Tsugama received three.

{"time_completed": 1741945580, "prefix": "Like other crustaceans, lobsters have a hard exoskeleton which they must shed in order to grow, in a process called ecdysis (molting). This may occur several times a year for young lobsters, but decreases to once every 1\u20132 years for larger animals. The first pair of pereiopods is armed with a large, asymmetrical pair of feet. The larger one is the \"crusher\", and has rounded nodules used for crushing prey; the other is the \"cutter\", which has sharp inner edges, and is used for holding or tearing the prey. Usually, the left claw is the crusher, and the right is the cutter. The exoskeleton is generally blue above, with spots that coalesce, and yellow below. The red colour associated with lobsters only appears after cooking. This occurs because, in life, the red pigment astaxanthin is bound to a protein complex, but the complex is broken up by the heat of cooking, releasing the red pigment. The closest relative of H. gammarus is the American lobster, Homarus americanus. The two species are very similar, and can be crossed artificially, although hybrids are unlikely to occur in the wild since their ranges do not overlap. The two species can be distinguished by a number of characteristics: The rostrum of H. americanus bears one or more spines on the underside, which are lacking in H. gammarus. The spines on the claws of H. americanus are red or red-tipped, while those of H. gammarus are white or white-tipped. The underside of the claw of H. americanus is orange or red, while that of H. gammarus is creamy white or very pale red. Female H. gammarus reach sexual maturity when they have grown to a carapace length of , whereas males mature at a slightly smaller size.

{"time_completed": 1741946063, "prefix": "A surviving film still gives the possibility of identifying eight actors. The single reel comedy, approximately 1,000 feet long, was released on September 27, 1910. The film likely had a wide national release, with advertisements in theaters known in Indiana, Kansas, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. The film would also be shown in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada and was met with praise by the audience at the Province Theatre. In 1917, years after the film's release, the film was approved without censorship by the Pennsylvania State Board of Censors of Moving Pictures. The Moving Picture World reviewer found the subject to be too long, but did not find it to be a fault. The reviewer states, \"A domestic comedy with a different flavor. In fact, with a mince pie for a basis the flavor comes to resemble brandy very strongly by the time that the cook, the maid and the mistress of the house and her daughter have added the proper proportion of flavoring, neither one knowing that the others have done likewise. The humor in this piece centers around this pie. What happened to the guests who partook of it certainly draws upon the imagination. Imagine eight people, not to speak of the cat, getting drunk on the brandy in one mince pie! ... We do not single out this subject as being more evidently padded than others shown on the screen this week. Licensed as well as Independents were guilty and it is time that the manufacturers realize the importance of the scenario end of matters. The mince pie episode was well done, which is the faint praise that we do not like to mete out to anyone.\" Walton of The Moving Picture News was not amused by the plot and stated, \"To me the last scene had no humor. It was only the necessary ending to the beginning. True humor does not emanate from cognac.\" The New York Dramatic Mirror stated, \"This is the old story of too many cooks, and it is quite funny after the first scenes are out of the way. The early part of the film takes too much time with trivial details leading up to the final situation. ... A weak point in the story is the fact that the pie is cut into eight small pieces, making it difficult to believe in its remarkable power.

The cast would be also more effective if they were really amateurs and not professionals trying hard to be amateurs. There would be all sorts of opportunity for effective character work if real people were trying their hands for the first and last time. It would be a real drama, and the effects on screen would be better for it. The pros would spoil it. In the film as now produced it would be one thing too many. It would be a definite step backwards in the evolution of a real drama on a screen. As a drama it would be quite sufficient. To be true the scenario and all preparations for it should be done entirely by amateur writers and actors and directed entirely by amateurs. That would make a realistic and really humorous drama.

Bob Strauss of Entertainment Weekly gave the game an A+ and wrote that it was a very fast game, yet never felt chaotic or impossible, and they later named it the best game available in 1991. Primarily because of its Genesis bundling, Sonic the Hedgehog popularized the console in North America, thus making it a competitor to Nintendo and their Super Nintendo Entertainment System. During October\u2013December 1991, the Genesis outsold the Super NES by two to one; at its January 1992 peak it had 65 percent of the market for 16-bit consoles. Although Nintendo eventually overtook Sega, it was the first time since December 1985 that Nintendo did not lead the console market. Sonic the Hedgehog inspired similar platformers starring animal mascots, including Bubsy, Aero the Acro-Bat, James Pond 3, Earthworm Jim, Zero the Kamikaze Squirrel, and Radical Rex. \"Animal with attitude\" games carried over to the next generation of consoles, with the developers of Crash Bandicoot and Gex citing Sonic as a major inspiration. Sonic's success led to an extensive media franchise, with the first of many sequels, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, released the following year. It has generated dozens of additional games and a large cast of recurring characters, keeping Sonic and Robotnik (later renamed as Eggman) mainstays, and continued beyond Sega's exit from the console industry after the Dreamcast.", "gold_completion": "The series has ventured from platformers to fighting, racing, role-playing, and sports games, and also expanded into anime, manga, cartoons comic books, novels, and toys.

Sonic the Hedgehog was praised by critics, with an 86% rating at the review aggregator GameRankings. It was considered Sega's answer to Nintendo's widely popular Mario series, as it was a platformer featuring the company's mascot. Paul Rand of Computer and Video Games compared the two in depth and characterized Sonic the Hedgehog as being faster, with brighter colors, and Super Mario World as having more \"depth of play\". Frank Ladoire of believed Sonic the Hedgehog was part of a new generation of games that demonstrate that the Genesis is capable of \"beautiful things\" in the technical department. Reviewers praised the colorful, detailed graphics. Rand called its color scheme \"lively, but never garish\", praising the interaction of color with detail in the sprites, backgrounds, and animations and describing its graphics as the best available for the Genesis. Reviewer Boogie Man of GamePro called the intricate backgrounds \"eye-popping\" and \"gorgeous\", which was echoed by Mean Machines. The Lessers (Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk) of Dragon claimed the graphics made Sonic a possible contender for the best game of 1991 and GameZone called the animation \"some of the smoothest and fastest ... ever seen\". Julian Boardman of Raze praised the \"colourful and highly detailed\" backdrops and \"fabulous\" sprites. The music and sound effects were also well received; Dragon called them \"great\", and GameZone \"amazing\". Rand praised the \"catchy\" soundtrack, calling some of the sound effects \"absolutely brilliant\". Although Mean Machines called the songs \"vaguely appealing\", the sound effects were better appreciated.", "gold_completion": "However, Boardman of Raze considered the music \"a little boring\". Critics cited the fast gameplay, unprecedented in platformers. The difficulty was disputed, described as \"impossible\" by Rand and \"average\" by EGM.

MegaTech Magazine said that it \"fits right\" and GamePro \"really work[s] out\" (the writers were referring to the two lives in both rows being removed from a total of three). The board configuration and the multiple lives were also critically received; GamePro said it \"can be played [twice] as it [has two lives] and it [has three levels]\". The board configuration and multiple lives were also widely derided. Dragon termed the board configuration and multiple lives as \"bloody annoying\" and \"practically suicidal\" and the extra lives were termed as \"one of gaming's most evil ploys\" and \"one of gaming's most horrific gimmicks\".

The Keetoowah Band states that Churchill still holds the associate membership and it has not been rescinded. In a separate interview, Ernestine Berry, formerly on the tribe's enrollment committee and four years on its council, said that Churchill had never fulfilled a promise to help the tribe.

Since contemporaneous biographies (Wen's work was not published until 1830) make no mention of these events, it has been suggested that they were fabricated after Hu's death. Hu retired from public life and went into seclusion in 1646, after the end of the Ming dynasty. Xiao Yuncong and L\u00fc Liuliang recorded visiting him during his later years, in 1667 and 1673 respectively. He died in poverty at the age of 90, sometime around late 1673 or early 1674. Hu Zhengyan was a noted seal-carver, producing personal seals for numerous dignitaries. His style was rooted in the classical seal script of the Han dynasty, and he followed the Huizhou school of carving founded by his contemporary He Zhen. Hu's calligraphy, although balanced and with a clear compositional structure, is somewhat more angular and rigid than the classical models he followed. Huizhou seals attempt to impart an ancient, weathered impression, although unlike other Huizhou artists Hu did not make a regular practice of artificially aging his seals. Hu's work was known outside his local area. Zhou Lianggong, a poet who lived in Nanjing around the same time as Hu and was a noted art connoisseur, stated in his Biography of Seal-Carvers (Yinren Zhuan, ) that Hu \"creates miniature stone carvings with ancient seal inscriptions for travellers to fight over and treasure\", implying that his carvings were popular with visitors and travellers passing through Nanjing. In 1644, Hu took it upon himself to create a new Imperial seal for the Hongguang Emperor, which he carved after a period of fasting and prayer.", "gold_completion": "He presented his creation with an essay, the Great Exhortation of the Seal (Dabao Zhen, ), in which he bemoaned the loss of the Chongzhen Emperor's seal and begged Heaven's favour in restoring it. Hu was concerned that his essay would be overlooked because he had not written it in the form of rhyming, equally-footed couplets (pianti, ) used in the Imperial examinations, but his submission and the seal itself were nevertheless both accepted by the Southern Ming court.", "gen_completion": ["He later recounted this experience to Xiao Yuncong and Xiao Yuncon included a description of this seal in his later (1673) Xu Xiaobiao. The two major seals carved by Hu are not described by Xiao Yuncong and are not known to exist today. The first is a \"mountain and river\" (shanshui tao) seal which he made for Xu Douwu. The second seal which he carved is said to be a \"stork\" (ying) seal, and Xiao Yuncong notes that it was this seal which brought Hu renown. He also developed a unique seal script which he used for a personal seal. The script was later described as \"severe and powerful\" (guangshi fu) and \"hard and tough\" (huangshi ma). This script would later be described as \"fast\" (pu) and \"rattling\" (bengang). Hu began experimenting with stone during his later years. Xiao Yuncong visited him while he lived in a cave. During this time period he also experimented with yang and yin and his \"reclusive cave\" seal script. In his later years he also began creating gemstones. Xiao Yuncong writes that he often prayed and devoted his life to Buddhism and Taoism.

Keating moved to a location from where it could provide direct fire onto the ridge, and a forward artillery observer was placed with Edson's front line units. Late in the afternoon, Edson stepped onto a grenade box and addressed his exhausted troops, saying, Edson's speech \"raised the spirits\" of the Raiders and helped them prepare mentally for the night ahead. As the sun set on 13 September, Kawaguchi faced Edson's 830 Marines with 3,000 troops of his brigade, plus an assortment of light artillery. The night was pitch black, with no moon. At 21:00, seven Japanese destroyers briefly bombarded the ridge. Kawaguchi's attack began just after nightfall, with Kokusho's battalion assaulting Raider Company B on the Marine right flank, just to the west of the ridge. The force of the assault caused Company B to fall back to Hill 123. Under Marine artillery fire, Kokusho reassembled his men and continued his attack. Without pausing to try to \"roll-up\" the other nearby Marine units, whose flanks were now unprotected, Kokusho's unit surged forward through the swampy lowlands between the ridge and the Lunga River, heading for the airfield. Kokusho's men came upon a pile of Marine supplies and rations. Not having eaten adequately for a couple of days, they paused to \"gorge themselves\" on the \"C\" and \"K\" rations. Kokusho ordered his men to continue the attack. At about 03:00, he led them against the Marine units around the northern portion of the ridge, just short of the airfield, as well as Hill 123. In the heavy fighting that followed, Kokusho and around 100 of his men were killed, ending that attack.

We took our lessons from the Germans and we know how they treated all their prisoners. However, we will not behave that way. We will not shoot captured prisoners. If we take prisoners we will keep them fed and clothed and will treat them according to their rank.\" Edson and his Marines knew the Japanese would attempt to capture their position. They waited for hours for a Japanese attack. Late in the evening on 13 September, a group of Japanese came out from the swamp. \"What we feared most came to pass,\" Edson later reported. The Japanese moved through a swamp-covered area that created loud splashes and kept Edson's Marines on alert. They saw a group of Japanese moving towards their position through a thick area of vegetation.

{"time_completed": 1741957728, "prefix": "With the guerrillas requiring supplies, Koos de la Rey lead a force of 3,000 Boers against Brakfontein, on the Elands River in Western Transvaal. The post held a large quantity of stores and was defended by 300 Australians and 200 Rhodesians. The attack began on 4 August 1900 with heavy shelling causing 32 casualties. During the night the defenders dug in, enduring shelling and rifle fire. A relief force was stopped by the Boers, while a second column turned back believing that the post had already been relieved. The siege lasted 11 days, during which more than 1,800 shells were fired into the post. After calls to surrender were ignored by the defenders, and not prepared to risk a frontal attack, the Boers eventually retired. The Siege of Elands River was one of the major achievements of the Australians during the war, with the post finally relieved on 16 August. In response the British adopted counter-insurgency tactics, including a scorched earth policy involving the burning of houses and crops, the establishment of concentration camps for Boer women and children, and a system of blockhouses and field obstacles to limit Boer mobility and to protect railway communications. Such measures required considerable expenditure, and caused much bitterness towards the British, however they soon yielded results. By mid-1901, the bulk of the fighting was over, and British mounted units would ride at night to attack Boer farmhouses or encampments, overwhelming them with superior numbers. Indicative of warfare in last months of 1901, the New South Wales Mounted Rifles travelled and were involved in 13 skirmishes, killing 27 Boers, wounding 15, and capturing 196 for the loss of five dead and 19 wounded. Other notable Australian actions included Slingersfontein, Pink Hill, Rhenosterkop and Haartebeestefontein. Australians were not always successful however, suffering a number of heavy losses late in the war. On 12 June 1901, the 5th Victorian Mounted Rifles lost 19 killed and 42 wounded at Wilmansrust, near Middleburg after poor security allowed a force of 150 Boers to surprise them.", "gold_completion": "On 30 October 1901, Victorians of the Scottish Horse Regiment also suffered heavy casualties at Gun Hill, although 60 Boers were also killed in the engagement. Meanwhile, at Onverwacht on 4 January 1902, the 5th Queensland Imperial Bushmen lost 13 killed and 17 wounded. Ultimately the Boers were defeated, and the war ended on 31 May 1902.", "gen_completion": ["The Mounted Rifles were the last Australian Army regiment in South Africa. On 29 July 1901 they were part of a small force which attacked a group of 29 German officers holding Mafeking. The Australians opened fire on a church near which the Germans were barracked. When this failed to bring about a surrender 19 Australians charged the German positions. After fierce hand-to-hand fighting, the German officers surrendered. However three Australians were wounded and five were killed. The last Australian forces were finally withdrawn on 13 July 1902. The cost of the war was about 12 million Australian pounds (about $212 million in today\u2019s dollars), about 12% of the annual national government budget for 1902. The losses were heaviest in 1901: about 9% of all those enrolled; and about 2% in 1902. A more complete cost and effect would involve the economic cost to England and Germany. The war cost England about 2 million pounds a month and more than 30 million pounds in total. The war cost Germany about 1 million a month and about 150 million pounds in total.

In 1985, the final season that Richmond competed for Beadle, his best finish was a second-place run at Bristol. He ended the season 11th in points with 13 Top 10s in 28 races. In the Busch Series, he qualified at the pole position in the two races he entered, and won the Charlotte race. Richmond joined Hendrick Motorsports in 1986, where he teamed up with veteran crew chief Harry Hyde. It took the team until the middle of the season to gel. Richmond had suffered a 64-race winless streak that was finally broken at the Van Scoy Diamond Mine 500 at Pocono in June 1986. After two straight second-place finishes at Charlotte and Riverside, Richmond started the Pocono event in third place inside the second row. That race saw a caution for rain with five laps left before the halfway point. NASCAR wanted the cars to get to the halfway point to make the race official, so the sanctioning body had the drivers slowly circle the track. It took the drivers 26 minutes to complete the laps, and the rain was so heavy that some drivers had to look out their side windows because they could not see out their windshields. Two hours later, the track had dried and the race resumed with Richmond in third. After Richmond's car was adjusted to remove the \"push\", the car was more to his liking. Because his radio did not work, he was unable to communicate with his crew chief, Hyde, and he made his final pit stop with 37 laps left. Hyde worried that Richmond had stopped a lap too early to ensure that he would have enough fuel to make it to the end. After Richmond took the lead with 30 laps left in the race, Dale Earnhardt made up three seconds on Richmond's five-second lead. With four laps to go, Buddy Arrington spun in a three-car accident. The remaining laps of the race where completed slowly under caution and Richmond took the checkered flag for the victory.

With two laps to go and a 2-second lead, a caution flag came out for fog and the track was cleared.[21] The 29 laps until the finish were completed in 21 minutes, and A.J. Foyt's 1999 team led until two laps remained. Earnhardt got ahead and ended up a half-car length ahead of A.J. Foyt and Dale Earnhardt when he exited his vehicle for a pump and received a 15-second penalty for a pit-stop violation. The drivers raced through one more lap and Richmond was declared the winner.

That at the heel of the sail being at 27\u00b0 and that at the tip being 15\u00b0, decreasing by 1\u00bd\u00b0 at each sail bar. Three of the four sails had been completed at the end of the work in. The fantail and associated gearing was fitted to the mill. At the end of the second work-in, the cap could be turned by means of the hand crank. The fantail itself, with the blades painted red, white and blue was installed shortly afterwards. The clasp arm brake wheel was assembled around the windshaft. It was found that the wallower was eccentric on the upright shaft by \u00bd inch (13 mm). When this was corrected the brake wheel was within 1/16 th of an inch (less than 1 mm) of true. The clamps for the stocks were sawn from a baulk of pitch pine ready for completion later in the year. Other work included a new frame for one of the ground floor doors, cleaning and painting ironwork and further repointing on the brickwork. The four sails were fitted to the mill with the aid of a mobile crane at the end of the second work-in. The stock, with one sail attached was carefully inserted through the poll end of the windshaft and when wedged in position and the clamps had been attached the second sail was fitted to the stock. The process was repeated for the second pair of sails. The mill turned by wind again on the last day of the second work-in. Work later in the year included the finishing of the fourth sail, balancing the fantail and sorting out teething troubles with the fantail gearing.

Heavy rains from the storm triggered significant flooding along the Sabana River in Acapulco, killing four people. However, the overall effects of Beatriz were limited and the rains were largely beneficial in mitigating a severe drought. On June 16, 2011, a trough situated off the southern coast of Guatemala showed signs of possible tropical cyclogenesis. Though located within an area favoring development, the system remained broad and disorganized as it moved slowly west-northwestward. Gradually, convection consolidated around an area of low pressure. On June 18, a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert was issued for the system as it was expected to develop into a tropical depression within 24 hours. On the following day, the low further developed and was declared Tropical Depression Two-E by the National Hurricane Center at 1500 UTC. Upon being declared, the depression was located about 335 mi (540 km) south-southeast of L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, Mexico. However, after post-analysis, the depression had actually developed nine hours earlier. Maintaining a west-northwesterly track in response to a subtropical ridge to the north, the depression was forecast to move into a favorable environment, characterized by low wind shear and sea surface temperatures up to . Three hours after classification, the depression strengthened Tropical Storm Beatriz, the second named storm of the season. Early on June 20, convection increased markedly with several overshooting tops (denoted by cloud-top temperatures below ) appearing on satellite imagery. A notable increase in southerly outflow also took place.

To be sure, during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result, it has frequently become involved in foreign wars. Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers\u2014known colloquially as Diggers\u2014have often been noted, somewhat paradoxically, for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities. From 1788 until 1870 the defence of the Australian colonies was mostly provided by British Army regular forces. Originally Marines protected the early settlements at Sydney Cove and Norfolk Island, however they were relieved of these duties in 1790 by a British Army unit specifically recruited for colonial service, known as the New South Wales Corps. The New South Wales Corps subsequently was involved in putting down a rebellion of Irish convicts at Castle Hill in 1804. Soon however shortcomings in the corps convinced the War Office of the need for a more reliable garrison in New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land. Chief of these shortcomings was the Rum Rebellion, a coup mounted by its officers in 1808. As a result, in January 1810 the 73rd (Perthshire) Regiment of Foot arrived in Australia. By 1870, 25 British infantry regiments had served in Australia, as had a small number of artillery and engineer units. Although the primary role of the British Army was to protect the colonies against external attack, no actual threat ever materialised. The British Army was instead used in policing, guarding convicts at penal institutions, combating bushranging, putting down convict rebellions\u2014as occurred at Bathurst in 1830\u2014and to suppress Aboriginal resistance to the extension of European settlement. Notably British soldiers were involved in the battle at the Eureka Stockade in 1854 on the Victorian goldfields. Members of British regiments stationed in Australia also saw action in India, Afghanistan, New Zealand and the Sudan. During the early years of settlement the naval defence of Australia was provided by units detached by the Royal Navy's Commander-in-Chief, East Indies, based in Sydney.", "gold_completion": "However, in 1859 Australia was established as a separate squadron under the command of a commodore, marking the first occasion that Royal Navy ships had been permanently stationed in Australia. The Royal Navy remained the primary naval force in Australian waters until 1913, when the Australia Station ceased and responsibility handed over to the Royal Australian Navy; the Royal Navy's depots, dockyards and structures were given to the Australian people.", "gen_completion": ["In 1825 and 1826 a Russian squadron threatened Sydney and briefly landed troops before being forced to withdraw. In 1839 a French squadron appeared off Sydney and was soon forced to withdraw, but by 1839 a more secure defence had been established. The navy later played a key role during the Second World War. The post-war period saw the introduction of Australian units. The most notable was 1 RAR, raised on 29 September 1951 for service in Korea. Apart from this Australian Army unit\u2014and also RA (Australia), a separate Australian Army regiment later absorbed into 1 RAR\u2014no others were raised until 1965 and 1969.\nCadet movement[edit]\nMain articles: Australian Army Cadet Force and Australian Army Cadet League\nThree levels of military-type youth activities were established.

As early as 200 AD Teotihuacan had embassies in Tikal. The fourteenth king of Tikal was Chak Tok Ich'aak (Great Jaguar Paw). Chak Tok Ich'aak built a palace that was preserved and developed by later rulers until it became the core of the Central Acropolis. Little is known about Chak Tok Ich'aak except that he was killed on 14 January 378 AD.

Siyah K\u2019ak' was probably a foreign general serving a figure represented by a non-Maya hieroglyph of a spearthrower combined with an owl, a glyph that is well known from the great metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico. Spearthrower Owl may even have been the ruler of Teotihuacan. These recorded events strongly suggest that Siyah K\u2019ak' led a Teotihuacan invasion that defeated the native Tikal king, who was captured and immediately executed. Siyah K'ak' appears to have been aided by a powerful political faction at Tikal itself; roughly at the time of the conquest, a group of Teotihuacan natives were apparently residing near the Lost World complex. He also exerted control over other cities in the area, including Uaxactun, where he became king, but did not take the throne of Tikal for himself.

The original brake wheel was too rotten to repair, and showed evidence that it had been altered from the original one installed in 1819. The original brake wheel was diameter to allow the Common sails to run at their optimum speed. When the mill was modernised in 1832 it was necessary to alter the gear ratios within the mill, as Patent sails run at a slower speed than Common sails. The great spur wheel was increased in diameter and the stone nuts reduced in diameter. The brake wheel was also rebuilt, with a cast-iron segment ring fitted in place of the original cogs, resulting in a wheel in diameter. The opinion of professional millwrights was sought, and it was decided that a scaled-up version of the original brake wheel would be made, but retaining the cast iron teeth segments. The remains of the original brake wheel were retained as an exhibit in the mill. The original iron segments were all broken, so a pattern was made and new segments were cast in heat-treated malleable cast iron. When the brake wheel was completed it was dismantled and transported to the mill ready for reassembly. The fantail was made. Some of the small gears were replaced. The stocks were made from pitch pine and the blades from Douglas fir. Work at the mill over the winter included repairs to the brickwork and windows, with only one window still needing attention when the first work-in began. New beech cogs were fitted to the crown wheel, which was restored to its correct position on the upright shaft. The stocks and sails were made during the two work-ins held in July and August, a total of 41 people attending over the two weeks. A second-hand stock had been bought in the 1920s and preserved at the mill, but upon examination it was found to be unfit for use. Thus two new stocks were required instead of one.", "gold_completion": "Modern steel stocks had already been discounted on cost and durability grounds, leaving two options. Traditional stocks made from a single piece of timber, or laminated stocks. Good quality pitch pine was not obtainable in the lengths required. Douglas fir was obtainable in such lengths but was discounted on strength and durability grounds. A Douglas fir stock on a nearby mill had rotted after only seven years. Thus it was decided that laminated stocks would be made. The long stocks were made from Douglas fir. All timber had been pressure treated with preservative and well seasoned.", "gen_completion": ["It was decided upon a modified Dutch-type sail design. Such a design is the closest type to the original one which was installed in 1819. The two wedge-shaped sails were joined together and mounted onto a double-skinned aluminium stock. The two windshields were mounted on a piece of aluminium angle-iron which acted as a support and kept them aligned. A centre post for tying-off was fitted. The centre post doubled as a winch for winding a balancing chain on which the mill was originally balanced. This centre post was housed within a white enamel piece, which was then chromed. The white enamel and chromium were a polychrome finish. The roof weather-boarding and window casings were restored and a few stripes were added. The interior and exterior paintwork was also refreshed. The ventilation was improved and replaced where necessary. The internal stairs were re-painted and a few stripes added. Three doors were also added which connect to a first-floor enclosed work-space. The enclosed space allows more working area and also keeps out cold air. Work began on re-roofing the two-storey gable end; this will continue once all the interior wood-working is complete. The interior wood-working includes floor-coverings and woodwork on all the interior doors.

In the Democratic primary, Beckham defeated Augustus O. Stanley, a 12-year veteran of the House of Representatives. The Republican nominee was former Governor Augustus E. Willson. Bolstered by his support of President Woodrow Wilson, Beckham won the election by 32,000 votes. Beckham served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Expenditures in the US Department of Labor from 1915 to 1917 and on the Senate Committee on Military Affairs. In the latter position, he was influential in securing two large military training posts for Kentucky: Camp Zachary Taylor and Fort Knox. Though Camp Zachary Taylor was abandoned after World War I, Fort Knox became the home of the US Bullion Depository. After the United States entered World War I, Beckham continued to back Wilson and later supported the League of Nations. True to his prohibitionist stance, Beckham supported passage of the Eighteenth Amendment, which enacted Prohibition in the United States. The amendment was ratified and became effective in January 1920. Believing that women should be protected from involvement in politics, Beckham opposed the Nineteenth Amendment, which granted women's suffrage. The amendment failed on February 10, 1919 but passed on June 4, 1919. Beckham voted against it both times. The Democrats renominated Beckham without opposition in 1920. His opponent in the general election was Republican Richard P. Ernst. Prohibition had destroyed the distilling industry and the saloon business in the state, and in areas that those industries were prominent, Beckham received more than 5,000 fewer votes than Democratic presidential nominee James M. Cox. He was also hurt by the women's vote and by his support of Wilson, who had lost popularity since Beckham's election, in 1914. Ernst won the election by fewer than 5,000 votes, winning the race with 50.3% of the vote to Beckham's 49.7&%. During his only term in the Senate, Beckham served alongside three other US Senators from Kentucky: Ollie M. James, George B. Martin, and Augustus O. Stanley.

{"time_completed": 1741963859, "prefix": "Mycena inclinata, commonly known as the clustered bonnet or the oak-stump bonnet cap, is a species of mushroom in the family Mycenaceae. The doubtfully edible mushroom has a reddish-brown bell-shaped cap up to in diameter. The thin stem is up to tall, whitish to yellow-brown at the top but progressively becoming reddish-brown towards the base in maturity, where they are covered by a yellowish mycelium that can be up to a third of the length of the stem. The gills are pale brown to pinkish, and the spore print is white. It is a widespread saprobic fungus, and has been found in Europe, North Africa, Asia, Australasia, and North America, where it grows in small groups or tufts on fallen logs and stumps, especially of oak. British mycologist E.J.H. Corner has described two varieties of the mushroom from Borneo. Lookalike species with which M. inclinata may be confused include M. galericulata and M. maculata. First described as Agaricus inclinatus by Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries in 1838, it was assigned its current name in 1872 by Lucien Qu\u00e9let. Mycena galericulata var. calopus (named by Karsten in 1879), and its basionym Agaricus galericulatus var. calopus (named by Fries in 1873), are synonyms. In a molecular study of the large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences of mycorrhizal fungi of the orchid Gastrodia confusa, M. inclinata was found to be closely related to M. aurantiomarginata, M. crocata, and M. leaiana.

In growth, they frequently appear as if enveloped and coiled about by insects, ants or mites. The two hyphae which connect it with the stalk are enclosed by a sort of bag of mites. Mycelium near this hypha will be filled with mites; hence the term \"mitten\" and its synonymous \"baggyn\" which were used to designate this peculiarity. The term \"baggyn\" or \"mitten\" was used as a description as early as 1829 by scientist John Lindley. The term \"clump\" also refers to groups or clusters of this type of fungus. The term \"the mitten\" can also be used as a designation for a different genus Mycena, but not M. inclinata.

{"time_completed": 1741964456, "prefix": "The easiest and most popular climbing routes are categorized as Class 1 to 2 or A+ in mountaineering parlance. Mount Elbert is therefore often referred to as the \"gentle giant\" that tops all others in the Rocky Mountains. Mount Elbert is visible to the southwest of Leadville, often snow-capped even in the summer. Many other fourteeners surround Elbert in all directions, and it is very close to central Colorado's Collegiate Peaks. The neighboring Mount Massive, to the north, is the second-highest peak in the Rocky Mountains and the third-highest in the contiguous United States, and La Plata Peak, to the south, is the fifth-highest in the Rockies. The community of Twin Lakes lies at the base of Mount Elbert, Denver is about to the east, Vail is to the north, and Aspen is to the west. Leadville, about to the northeast, is the nearest large town. Elbert's parent peak is Mount Whitney in California. Including Alaska and Hawaii, Mount Elbert is the fourteenth-highest mountain in the United States. Weather conditions often change rapidly, and afternoon thunderstorms are common in the summertime; hailstorms and snow are possible year-round. An electrical storm on the mountain's summit was considered remarkable enough to be reported in the July 1894 issue of Science. Mount Elbert is part of the Sawatch Range, an uplift of the Laramide Orogeny which separated from the Mosquito Range to the east around 28 million years ago. The tops of this range were heavily glaciated, leaving behind characteristic summit features and other such clues. For example, the base of Elbert on the eastern side exhibits large igneous and metamorphic rocks deposited when the glaciers receded, which lie on a lateral moraine. Further up the eastern side there is a large cirque with a small tarn. There are also lakes to both the north and south, Turquoise and Twin Lakes respectively; the Twin Lakes are a result of the natural dam of end moraines, and Turquoise Lake was created by the manmade Sugar Loaf Dam. Mount Elbert is composed largely of quartzite.", "gold_completion": "However, the summit ridge consists of metamorphic basement rock, which is Pre-Cambrian in origin and about 1.7 billion years old. There are various igneous intrusions including pegmatite, as well as bands of gneiss and schist. Unlike mountains of similar altitude elsewhere, Elbert lacks both a permanent snowpack and a prominent north-facing cirque, which can be attributed to its position among other mountains of similar height, causing it to receive relatively small quantities of precipitation.", "gen_completion": ["A popular winter sport on Mount Elbert is alpine touring. Elbert and neighboring Mount Massive were also a location where minerals were once found, and which are now largely panned out. There are also a number of ghost towns around Mount Elbert. Due to the terrain being more suited for summer mountaineering and winter alpine touring than for skiing, Elbert rarely has enough snow for a ski area. However, there are two near-summit backcountry ski areas on Mount Elbert: Yellow Jacket (N 38.29299 W 106.13331); and The Point (N 38.31322 W 106.12091). Due to a clear distinction from their neighbor, Mount Elbert is often separately referred to as Mount Yale; however this is not true. Mount Yale (39.21912 -106.23383) is a notable landmark and neighbor, about 3.1 km (2 mi) southwest of Mount Elbert. Due to its own prominence, Yale is often mistaken for being Elbert; however Elbert has a higher prominence. A number of popular hiking trails and ski areas are located on Mount Yale.

In 2012, Radcliffe was quoted as saying: \"I'm an atheist, and a militant atheist when religion starts impacting on legislation\", though in a 2009 interview, he stated, \"I'm very relaxed about [being an atheist]. I don't preach my atheism, but I have a huge amount of respect for people like Richard Dawkins who do. Anything he does on television, I will watch\". In a 2019 interview, Radcliffe described himself as \"agnostic leaning toward atheism\". Radcliffe is a supporter of the Labour Party. Until 2012, Radcliffe had publicly supported the Liberal Democrats, and before the 2010 general election he endorsed Nick Clegg, the leader of the Liberal Democrats. In 2012, however, Radcliffe switched his allegiance to the Labour Party, citing disappointment with the performance of Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats in government, and approving of the Labour leader, Ed Miliband. In August 2015, Radcliffe endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He told The Big Issue: \"I feel like this show of sincerity by a man who has been around long enough and stuck to his beliefs long enough that he knows them and doesn't have to be scripted is what is making people sit up and get excited. It is great.\" He is a supporter of a British republic. He is also a supporter of British unionism. When asked about the Scottish independence referendum, he said he hoped the UK would \"stay as it is now\". On 13 April 2006, his portrait, drawn by Stuart Pearson Wright, was unveiled as part of a new exhibition opening at the National Theatre; it was then moved to the National Portrait Gallery. Speaking out against homophobia, Radcliffe began filming public service announcements in 2009 for The Trevor Project, promoting awareness of gay teen suicide prevention. He first learned of the organisation while working on Equus on Broadway in 2008 and has contributed financially to it. \"I have always hated anybody who is not tolerant of gay men or lesbians or bisexuals.", "gold_completion": "Now I am in the very fortunate position where I can actually help or do something about it,\" he said in a 2010 interview. In the same interview, he spoke of the importance of public figures advocating for equal rights. Radcliffe received The Trevor Project's Hero Award in 2011 for his contributions. In response to a series of tweets by J. K. Rowling criticising the phrase \"people who menstruate\" in June 2020, Radcliffe issued a statement through The Trevor Project.

He also supported various UK charities during 2011 including Scope and Comic Relief. He described Comic Relief as a \"great\" charity. On 11 September 2011 Radcliffe gave his first public reading from The Tales of Beedle The Bard (a collection of five fairy tales included in the Hogwarts Library), alongside Stephen Fry and Emma Watson. It raised \u00a3325,022. In 2013 Radcliffe co-starred alongside John Malkovich and Michael Keaton in the Broadway production of The Real Thing.

With these rail-based industries, the city was a great economic power in the state and region from about 1890 through 1930. Though its economy slowed with the decline of the railroading industry in the 1950s, the city has adapted, moving from a largely rail-based economy to a more diversified one, with healthcare, military, and manufacturing employing the most people. Along with Lauderdale County and the city of Marion, Meridian is served by the East Mississippi Business Development Corporation, which was formed in 1996 by a group of business leaders from the area. While as of April 2010, the city's civilian labor force was only 15,420 people, there is a population of 232,900 in a radius and 526,500 in a radius, of which 104,600 and 234,200 people respectively are in the labor force. The city thus serves as a hub of employment, retail, health care, and culture activities. Eighty percent of Lauderdale County's workers reside in the county while 90% live within 45 miles. In April 2020, there were 5,101 people employed in the healthcare field in Lauderdale County. Rush Health Systems is the largest healthcare organization in the region, employing 2,465 people, followed by Anderson Regional Health System with 1,343 and East Mississippi State Hospital with 943. There are two hospitals in Meridian, as well as many other healthcare-related facilities. Anderson Regional Medical Center provides cardiovascular surgery, a Level II newborn intensive-care unit, and a health and fitness center. In December 2010, Anderson bought Riley Hospital and absorbed its employees and stroke treatment center and rehabilitation services. Rush Foundation Hospital and the related Rush Health Systems operate a Specialty Hospital of Meridian, which offers long-term care for non-permanent patients who require more recovery time in a hospital setting. Other healthcare facilities in Meridian include the Alliance Health Center and East Mississippi State Hospital, the latter of which has been in operation since 1882. Retail is another major employer in the county, with 5,280 people employed in April 2010. Nearly $2 billion annually is spent on retail purchases in the city.

The area is also served by two military facilities, Naval Air Station Meridian and Key Field, which supply over 4,000 jobs to residents of the surrounding area. NAS Meridian provides training for naval carrier pilots and other enlisted personnel.", "gen_completion": ["Another major shopping center is The Square.

Edson and his first wave of 501 troops landed at Taivu at 05:20 (local time) on 8 September. Supported by aircraft from Henderson Field and gunfire from the destroyer transports, Edson's men advanced towards Tasimboko village but were slowed by Japanese resistance. At 11:00, the rest of Edson's men landed. With this reinforcement and more support from the Henderson Field aircraft, Edson's force pushed into the village. The Japanese defenders, believing a major landing was underway after observing the concurrent approach of an Allied supply ship convoy heading towards Lunga Point, retreated into the jungle, leaving behind 27 dead. Two Marines were killed. In Tasimboko, Edson's troops discovered the supply base for Kawaguchi's forces, including large stockpiles of food, ammunition and medical supplies, and a shortwave radio. The Marines seized documents, equipment and food supplies, destroyed the rest, and returned to the Lunga perimeter at 17:30. The quantities of supplies and intelligence from the captured documents revealed that at least 3,000 Japanese troops were on the island and apparently planning an attack. Edson and Colonel Gerald Thomas, Vandegrift's operations officer, believed that the Japanese attack would come at the Lunga Ridge, a narrow, grassy, long, coral ridge () parallel to the Lunga River just south of Henderson Field. The ridge offered a natural avenue of approach to the airfield, commanded the surrounding area and was almost undefended. Edson and Thomas tried to persuade Vandegrift to move forces to defend the ridge, but Vandegrift refused, believing that the Japanese were more likely to attack along the coast. Finally, Thomas convinced Vandegrift that the ridge was a good location for Edson's Raiders to \"rest\" from their actions of the preceding month.

Edson's troops maintained radio contact and his headquarters () and went about defending their positions. Edson sent patrols as far as (kilometres (kilometres (0 km)). To intercept a Japanese invasion of Edson's positions he would have to be prepared for a counterattack across hundreds of kilometers of ocean.

The separate colonies maintained control over their military and naval forces until Federation in 1901, when they were amalgamated and placed under the control of the new Commonwealth of Australia. During the early years of the 1880s, an Egyptian regime in the Sudan, backed by the British, came under threat from rebellion under the leadership of native Muhammad Ahmad (or Ahmed), known as Mahdi to his followers. In 1883, as part of the Mahdist War, the Egyptians sent an army to deal with the revolt, but they were defeated and faced a difficult campaign of extracting their forces. The British instructed the Egyptians to abandon the Sudan, and sent General Charles Gordon to co-ordinate the evacuation, but he was killed in January 1885. When news of his death arrived in New South Wales in February 1885, the government offered to send forces and meet the contingent's expenses. The New South Wales Contingent consisted of an infantry battalion of 522 men and 24 officers, and an artillery battery of 212 men and sailed from Sydney on 3 March 1885. The contingent arrived in Suakin on 29 March and were attached to a brigade that consisted of Scots, Grenadier and Coldstream Guards. They subsequently marched for Tamai in a large \"square\" formation made up of 10,000 men. Reaching the village, they burned huts and returned to Suakin: three Australians were wounded in minor fighting. Most of the contingent was then sent to work on a railway line that was being laid across the desert towards Berber, on the Nile. The Australians were then assigned to guard duties, but soon a camel corps was raised and 50 men volunteered.

{"time_completed": 1741968331, "prefix": "After this, Calakmul never again erected a monument celebrating a military victory. By the 7th century, there was no active Teotihuacan presence at any Maya site and the center of Teotihuacan had been razed by 700. Even after this, formal war attire illustrated on monuments was Teotihuacan style. Jasaw Chan K'awiil I and his heir Yik'in Chan K'awiil continued hostilities against Calakmul and its allies and imposed firm regional control over the area around Tikal, extending as far as the territory around Lake Pet\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. These two rulers were responsible for much of the impressive architecture visible today. In 738, Quirigu\u00e1, a vassal of Cop\u00e1n, Tikal's key ally in the south, switched allegiance to Calakmul, defeated Cop\u00e1n and gained its own independence. It appears that this was a conscious effort on the part of Calakmul to bring about the collapse of Tikal's southern allies. This upset the balance of power in the southern Maya area and lead to a steady decline in the fortunes of Cop\u00e1n. In the 8th century, the rulers of Tikal collected monuments from across the city and erected them in front of the North Acropolis. By the late 8th century and early 9th century, activity at Tikal slowed. Impressive architecture was still built but few hieroglyphic inscriptions refer to later rulers. By the 9th century, the crisis of the Classic Maya collapse was sweeping across the region, with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence. Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused Tikal's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself, accelerating the use of intensive agriculture and the corresponding environmental decline. Construction continued at the beginning of the century, with the erection of Temple 3, the last of the city's major pyramids, and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th K'atun in 810.", "gold_completion": "The beginning of the 10th Bak'tun in 830 passed uncelebrated, and marks the beginning of a 60-year hiatus, probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city. During this hiatus, satellite sites traditionally under Tikal's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the Mutal emblem glyph, with Tikal apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence.", "gen_completion": ["The following year saw one of Tikal's most notable monuments erected - the Temple of the Inscriptions. This monument was erected by Yich'aak B'ahlam I (whose monuments are notable for not mentioning his military conquests as would be expected of a ruler displaying his military prowess on monuments), on his fifth year anniversary as ruler. Monument 61 was also erected that year. In 811, Yich'aak B'ahlam I received the kingly title Yich'aak Bih Chan. In 822, Yich'aak B'ahlam I and Yich'aak Bih Chan were crowned king and queen and renamed Yich'aak K'ahk' Tzak and Yich'aak K'ahk' Aj.

The segment between Thompson and St. Ignace along the northern shore of Lake Michigan was designated the Top of the Lake Scenic Byway in the Pure Michigan Byways program on October 9, 2017.

The original structure, dating to 1918, is a spandrel arch span that was built by the MSHD as Trunk Line Bridge No. 191. The structure was listed on the NRHP on December 9, 1999, for its architectural and engineering significance. In December 2012, the National Park Service approved the listing of the Upper Twin Falls Bridge that crosses the Menominee River northwest of Iron Mountain. The structure is a single-span, pin-connected, camelback, through-truss bridge, and it is the only known example of its type in Michigan. It was built between 1909 and 1910 because the Twin Falls Power Dam would flood an existing river crossing. The span cost $5,106 (equivalent to $ in ), paid equally by Dickinson and Florence counties. Until the 1930s, the Upper Twin Falls Bridge carried US 2 across the Menominee River. In 1934, a new bridge was built about a mile downstream, and the highway was rerouted over the new span. The bridge closed to automobile traffic in September 1971, and the nomination process for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places began in 2012.

Jebav\u00fd corroborated Blythe's testimony that Blythe asked \"Are you okay?\" after Nosek fell and that the crowd gave him a positive reply.

{"time_completed": 1741971880, "prefix": "Three hours after classification, the depression strengthened Tropical Storm Beatriz, the second named storm of the season. Early on June 20, convection increased markedly with several overshooting tops (denoted by cloud-top temperatures below ) appearing on satellite imagery. A notable increase in southerly outflow also took place. As the subtropical ridge north of the storm weakened, Beatriz acquired a more northerly component to its track, bringing the center of the storm closer to Mexico. Convective bands gradually wrapped around the system throughout the day. During the afternoon hours of June 20, a hurricane hunter aircraft found Beatriz just below hurricane strength, and subsequently, the system was upgraded just a few hours later, while situated roughly 85 mi (140 km) southeast of Manzanillo, Mexico. Early on June 21, a wide eye developed within the central dense overcast. In light of this, the National Hurricane Center estimated Beatriz to have attained winds of 90 mph (150 km/h) along with a barometric pressure of 977 mbar (hPa; 28.85 inHg); however, it was noted that this could be conservative based on estimates of 105 mph (165 km/h) from the University of Wisconsin and the Satellite Analysis Branch. Throughout the morning of June 21, Beatriz brushed the coast of Mexico, with the center passing roughly 15 mi (20 km) south-southeast of La Fortuna, Mexico. Centered just off the coast of Mexico, the system interacted with land and began weakening. Hours later, convection rapidly diminished as dry air became entrained in the circulation. In response to quick degradation of the system's structure, the NHC downgraded Beatriz to a tropical storm. Rapid weakening continued throughout the day and by the evening hours, the storm no longer had a defined circulation. Lacking an organized center and deep convection, the final advisory was issued on Beatriz. The storm's remnants persisted for several more hours before dissipating roughly 175 mi (280 km) southwest of Cabo Corrientes, Jalisco.", "gold_completion": "Following the classification of Tropical Depression Two-E on June 19, the Government of Mexico issued a tropical storm warning for coastal areas between Zihuatanejo and Manzanillo. A hurricane watch was also put in place from Tecp\u00e1n de Galeana to Punta San Telmo. Later that day, the tropical storm warning was upgraded to a hurricane warning and the watch was extended westward to La Fortuna.

Two minutes into the video, U2 are seen on the roof of a liquor store at the corner of 7th St. and S. Main St., and perform \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" to a large crowd of people standing in the streets surrounding the building. Towards the end of the song, the police tell the crew that the performance is about to be shut down, and eventually police walk onto the roof while the crowd are booing the police. The video for \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" was directed by Meiert Avis and produced by Michael Hamlyn and Ben Dossett. The band attracted over 1,000 people during the video's filming, which took place on the rooftop of a liquor store in Downtown Los Angeles on 27 March 1987. The band's performance on a rooftop in a public place was a reference to the Beatles' final concert, as depicted in the film Let It Be. During the shoot U2 played an eight-song set, which included four performances of \"Where the Streets Have No Name\". Prior to filming, a week was spent reinforcing the roof of the liquor store to ensure it would not collapse if it were to be intruded by a group of fans. A backup generator was put on the roof so the shooting could continue in the event that the authorities shut off the power on the primary generator, which happened during filming. The depiction of the police attempting to shut down the filming due to safety concerns actually happened during filming, just as seen in the video. Hamlyn was almost arrested following a confrontation with the police. According to Avis, the events depicted in the video show what actually happened that day \"almost in real time\", and that \"getting busted was an integral part of the plan.\" Band manager Paul McGuinness revealed in 2007 that much of the confrontation with the police was exaggerated; the group were hoping to get shut down by the authorities in order to dramatize the music video, but the police continually gave them extensions for shooting the video.", "gold_completion": "In the background of the video is a sign for The Million Dollar Hotel, which was rebuilt to create some interest, in case no one showed up at the film shoot.

{"time_completed": 1741972792, "prefix": "When developing the series, they sought to find a medium between serialized drama and the crime procedural. \"The Same Old Story\" was the first regular episode of Fringe, and journalists viewed it as an example of what they could expect from the series. It was directed by Paul A. Edwards. After a newborn baby rapidly ages into an 80-year-old man, Fringe division agent Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) and consultants Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter Bishop (John Noble) investigate. They tie the case to the murders of young women, who have all had their pituitary glands removed. It is revealed that Dr. Claus Penrose (Mark Blum), an expert in progeria, is working to help his son Christopher (Derek Cecil) stay alive, as he suffers from rapid aging syndrome. \"The Same Old Story\" first aired in the United States on September 16, 2008 on Fox. An estimated 13.272 million viewers watched the episode, a 45 percent increase from the series premiere. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics \u2013 reviewers thought it was an improvement from the previous episode but faulted it for containing plot contrivances. A prostitute is abandoned by an unknown man at a hospital, dangerously in labor. She dies as the doctors perform a caesarean section, but the child ages rapidly in minutes, soon dead having aged to the likes of a 90-year-old man. Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), and Walter Bishop (John Noble), new members of the Fringe division, are called to investigate by division head Phillip Broyles (Lance Reddick), believing the case to be part of \"The Pattern\", a string of mysterious incidents. The woman is identified as having recently left a local motel, and Olivia finds evidence that points to a past serial murder case she and her former partner John Scott were not able to solve. Olivia explains to Peter that their murderer would paralyze his victims, young women, then make an incision along their face to extract a piece of brain material, killing the victim in the process.", "gold_completion": "Walter takes both corpses back to his lab and determines that the woman had only been pregnant minutes before giving birth, her child having accelerated aging disease. Walter is reminded of having previously done work in this field, and remembers where he stashed his car that contains the related files.

The killer was never found. When they were about to give up, a Jane Doe was found on a road. She turned out to be from one of the earlier cases and John was surprised that he could not guess a killer. Olivia thinks that now this murderer will not be as easy for Peter and Walter to figure out as they were not as familiar with the series. Fringe team arrives where they are checking out the women and Olivia finds out that all but two women have had their pituitary glands removed. Peter thinks it does not make sense and Olivia does not understand how that can happen and how can one not know if a part of their body has been removed. They realize they will be lucky if they solve the murder. In a pet shop, Fringe team finds out what they are trying to figure out as they know what they are trying to figure out as they know they are.

He was buried in Ashland, Ohio. The secrecy surrounding the circumstance of his death caused speculation for several days. At the time, Punch stated that Richmond had been hospitalized due to a motorcycle accident, though it is unlikely that Richmond had the strength to ride a motorcycle during his last months. Ten days after his death, on August 23, the Richmond family held a press conference to reveal that Richmond died from complications from AIDS, which he acquired from an unknown woman. Richmond's physician, Dr. David Dodson, said: \"There's no way of knowing who that woman was. Tim was a celebrity with a lot of charisma, a handsome guy. He naturally attracted a lot of women.\" Punch later claimed that more than 90 drivers and personnel underwent HIV testing in the wake of Richmond's death.

Baskin reported that sealed court documents and interviews showed Tennant and NASCAR used \"allegedly false drug-test results in 1988 to bar Richmond from racing\". Baskin also stated that NASCAR had targeted Richmond, requesting that Tennant establish a substance-abuse policy with Richmond in mind.

Thelnetham windmill worked by wind power until 1924, latterly on two sails, after which it became derelict. In 1979, a group of enthusiasts purchased Thelnetham windmill for restoration. Numerous volunteers helped to restore the mill to full working order over an eight-year period. The mill is open to the public, and flour ground at the mill can be bought at the site. The mill is a small four storey tower mill with Patent sails and winded by a fantail.", "gen_completion": ["The original mill dated from 1792 and the present brick tower was built in 1816. The interior workings were damaged during World War II and were subsequently not restored and were removed. As a result only two floors are now complete. The brick tower mill stands adjacent to a residential property. There are twenty eight working sails which are all painted white. The mill has been painted bright red with a white roof and black vertical stripes. In 2012 it was painted a bright red and white. It used to be used for a charity shop but this has now been moved.\n\nThelnetham Windmill in 2012.\n\nDrive and Geared Wallower Mill from 1909 on thesuffolk windmills group web-site"], "too_short": true, "z-score": [7.319931375965024, 4.95800546407708], "wm_pred": [1, 1], "gen_length": [172, 110], "num_green": [134, 81], "are_tokens_green": {"450": ["The", 1, 4], "2441": ["original", 0, 1], "3533": ["mill", 1, 3], "29797": ["dated", 1, 1], "515": ["from", 1, 2], "29871": ["", 1, 5], "29896": ["1", 1, 6], "29955": ["7", 0, 1], "29929": ["9", 1, 3], "29906": ["2", 1, 5], "322": ["and", 1, 6], "278": ["the", 0, 1], "2198": ["present", 1, 1], "28645": ["brick", 1, 2], "19372": ["tower", 1, 2], "471": ["was", 0, 2], "4240": ["built", 1, 1], "297": ["in", 0, 2], "29947": ["8", 0, 1], "29953": ["6", 0, 1], "29889": [".", 1, 9], "13290": ["interior", 1, 1], "664": ["work", 0, 1], "886": ["ings", 0, 1], "892": ["were", 1, 3], "5625": ["dam", 1, 1], "4063": ["aged", 1, 1], "2645": ["during", 1, 1], "2787": ["World", 1, 1], "3362": ["War", 1, 1], "1944": ["II", 1, 1], "17602": ["subsequently", 1, 1], "451": ["not", 1, 1], "23119": ["restored", 1, 1], "6206": ["removed", 1, 1], "1094": ["As", 1, 1], "263": ["a", 1, 5], "1121": ["result", 0, 1], "871": ["only", 0, 1], "1023": ["two", 1, 1], "5685": ["flo", 1, 1], "943": ["ors", 0, 1], "526": ["are", 1, 3], "1286": ["now", 1, 2], "4866": ["complete", 1, 1], "15028": ["stands", 0, 1], "20114": ["adjacent", 1, 1], "304": ["to", 0, 2], "20201": ["resident", 1, 1], "616": ["ial", 1, 1], "2875": ["property", 0, 1], "1670": ["There", 1, 1], "10081": ["twenty", 1, 1], "9475": ["eight", 1, 1], "1985": ["working", 1, 1], "269": ["s", 0, 1], "2234": ["ails", 1, 1], "607": ["which", 1, 1], "599": ["all", 1, 1], "23139": ["painted", 1, 3], "4796": ["white", 1, 3], "756": ["has", 0, 2], "1063": ["been", 1, 2], "11785": ["bright", 1, 2], "2654": ["red", 1, 2], "411": ["with", 0, 1], "17526": ["roof", 1, 1], "4628": ["black", 1, 1], "11408": ["vertical", 1, 1], "10076": ["stri", 1, 1], "5547": ["pes", 1, 1], "512": ["In", 1, 1], "29900": ["0", 0, 3], "372": ["it", 1, 1], "739": ["It", 1, 1], "1304": ["used", 1, 2], "367": ["be", 1, 1], "363": ["for", 1, 1], "1373": ["char", 0, 1], "537": ["ity", 0, 1], "18296": ["shop", 1, 1], "541": ["but", 1, 1], "445": ["this", 1, 1], "6153": ["moved", 1, 1], "13": ["\n", 0, 4], "1349": ["Th", 0, 1], "3478": ["eln", 0, 1], "621": ["eth", 1, 1], "314": ["am", 1, 1], "17311": ["Wind", 0, 1], "19958": ["mill", 1, 1], "29928": ["D", 1, 1], "4401": ["rive", 1, 1], "1879": ["Ge", 1, 1], "1965": ["ared", 1, 1], "14406": ["Wall", 1, 1], "1680": ["ower", 1, 1], "8649": ["Mill", 1, 1], "373": ["on", 1, 1], "266": ["th", 1, 1], "267": ["es", 1, 1], "3096": ["uff", 0, 1], "28387": ["olk", 0, 1], "8805": ["wind", 1, 1], "29885": ["m", 0, 1], "6090": ["ills", 1, 1], "2318": ["group", 1, 1], "1856": ["web", 1, 1], "29899": ["-", 1, 1], "2746": ["site", 0, 1]}}
